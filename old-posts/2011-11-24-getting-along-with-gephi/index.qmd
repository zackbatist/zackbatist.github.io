Over the last week or two I've been getting used to working with [Gephi](http://gephi.org) to visualize networks.
I've tinkered around before but now I finally had some real data to work with, even if it's very rudimentary.
I realize that I'm going to need to add to it, but one step at a time.
Carleton doesn't have copies of many of the excavation reports that I need, so I may need to venture afar to collect and record the data I need.
Who's up for a road trip?

Even though the network I ran is very simple, it's still progress in the right direction.
Take a look:

Dr. Graham took a look at the data and arranged it so the nodes represent the purpose of the pottery, rather than the type.
I tweaked it a bit before posting it, just to make it look better.
Here it is:

So far I'm getting the hang of things.
I find that by controlling the software I can get a better grasp of what network analysis is all about.
I'm guess you can say I'm a big proponent of **learning by doing!**
