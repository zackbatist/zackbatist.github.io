I've been kind of quiet lately.
After my last exam I've been taking a long break: video games, movies, sleep are my primary activities.
But starting next week I'll be working full time with the government and I have to pick myself up again.
It will be a good transition to grad school in the fall.
As for that, I got into McMaster's Anthropology MA with a focus on Archaeology.
I'm also thinking about applying to schools in England but I still have to get off my butt and work on the applications.
