Starting this past summer I decided to keep travel journals if I go somewhere interesting.
In Israel I did this on paper, and unfortunately I was too busy on the road in Greece to write down my thoughts.
I am in San Diego right now, and after picking up a notebook I realized that pen using pen and paper can be limiting.
Using an online format I can attach photos, add links to the people I meet, and make public recommendations of the places I go.
However, I won't be including this category on my home page or in my RSS feed, just because I don't want it to be the main purpose of my blog.

Pen and paper can be great for artistic folks who like to doodle or write intensive notes, but admittedly I don't do that all the time.
I liked the idea of having an offline mode of recording my thoughts all the time, but an electronic format better suits my own personality.
