After a long week with little sleep, followed by a night out with friends, I decided that today would be a sleep day.
I didn't set an alarm, I got up late, and I took my time.

Throughout the day I received no emails, no text messages, no spammy newsletters, and no other kinds of notifications.
It's amazing that I find this strange.
I never realized how much stress is caused by those little red bubbles telling me that something needs my attention, or that I have to respond to whoever is on the other end.
Don't get me wrong, I want to interact with friends and be up to date on various activities, but it's important to tune all of that out once in a while.

I'm glad that my sleep day went beyond just turning off my alarm.
It's funny how things work out that way.
