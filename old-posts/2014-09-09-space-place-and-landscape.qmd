This semester I'm taking a graduate course called The Anthropology of Space, Place and Landscape, which has a heavy emphasis on social theory.
Hopefully this course will help me to ground myself within social theory vis-a-vis geo-spatial archaeology, and help me figure out how to better involve these ideas in my own work.
I already have an idea to work with for the research paper, which will focus on a certain area covered in my M.A. thesis, and hopefully will also be publishable.

This is my second course taught by Dr. Roddick, and like with Writing the Field, it involves a blogging component.
This is meant to prompt critical reflection on the readings and keep us on our toes between classes.
My first piece will written this week, so stay tuned...
