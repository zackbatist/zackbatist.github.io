Archaeological projects are discrete collectives of knowledge production, which are held together by:

- establishing priorities and overarching research goals;
- establishing organizational structures that dictate roles and responsibilities;
- establishing technical procedures, protocols and infrastructures that facilitate understanding among project participants;
- allocating space, resources and funding that enables work to be done;
- fostering a sense of belonging through recognition as member of a team; and
- providing opportunities for students to learn through legitimate peripheral participation (e.g. situated learning) and by allocating responsibility to graduate students.
