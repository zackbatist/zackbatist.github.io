So I'm in Toronto for THATCamp GTA, which will be held tomorrow at Ryerson University's campus.
Today I got a first taste of academic collaboration at one of the workshops titled "How to Build a Born-Digital Project from the Ground Up".
As an undergrad, a lot of what was being discussed does not apply to me at the moment since I'm not currently working on a major project, but it's still good to know about this sort of thing.
It gives me a greater appreciation of the effort put into digital projects, and it also helps put a face to the organizers and producers that put these things together.

I'll make another post tomorrow after the conference, but I'll also be tweeting.
