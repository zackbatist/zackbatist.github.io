So this week is a biggie for archaeologists who pander in the digital realm.
[The Connected Past](http://connectedpast.soton.ac.uk/)Â was this weekend at the University of Southampton, and some great people were presenting.
Many of the topics are directly related to what I'm working on right now.
Too bad it was in the UK, eh.
Also currently going on at Southampton is the Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology conference, which seems like a blast.
And to top it off, the Day of DH was yesterday.
People have been tweeting like mad but I've been way too busy and it's impossible for me to keep up.
Too bad for me I guess.
