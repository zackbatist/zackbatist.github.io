It looks like spring is finally here.
The snow isÂ receding, the air is warmer and puddles of melted ice are everywhere.
But along with the seasonal changes comes the realization that I have less than a month of my BA left!
I can't believe it.
This last year has flown right by.
Now I just have to make that final push, keep up with it, and continue moving forward despite the desire to fast-forward through it all.

The thing is, it's getting increasingly hard to focus.
But I just need to remind myself that I'm almost there, and to take it one step at a time.
