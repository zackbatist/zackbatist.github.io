    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis third blog post for Writing the Field is a review of an Annual Reviews of Anthropology article. The article I chose to examine is titled Aspects of Regional Analysis in Archaeology by Gregory A. Johnson, published in 1977. Although it is not so recent, this article covers some fundamental developments regarding regional analysis in archaeology.\nThis article is very well laid out, starting with an overview of the broader assumptions archaeologists make regarding human decision making, and how these variables translate to our ideas regarding spatial interaction. Johnson then goes on to evaluate how these variables are applied, choosing to examine gravity models in greater detail. By discussing some of the key concepts that underlie this kind of model, Johnson prepares to engage the reader in discussions about how regional systems of interaction develop and operate.\nThe way that Johnson wrote this paper is well-thought out. He starts off by pointing towards some basic concepts that underlie the study of regional interaction. This allows non-specialized readers to engage with the language and the modes of thought that are commonly utilized when discussing such topics. Then he utilizes the gravity model to show how these fundamental principles can be fitted together in order to examine regional interaction, and also describes some deficiencies of this concept. By pointing out flaws associated with use of the gravity model, Johnson actually enhances the reader’s understanding of how the fundamental variables discussed earlier should be properly utilized. Johnson recognizes this and even goes on to say that “if gravity models provide nothing else, they do encourage archaeologists to consider more systematically the variables involved in interaction” (Johnson 1977:487).\nOnce the reader grasps how to properly understand and interpret ideas relating to regional interaction, Johnson goes on to discuss more complex issues that have been tackled using such a perspective. This portion of the article provides a more in depth look at the development of systems of interaction, which is embedded in discussions on the adoption of sedentary lifestyles and agricultural practices. These topics could not have been discussed through a lens of regional interaction without a prior understanding of the concepts relating to this sub-specialty.\nAs much as this article is a review of contemporary discussions concerning the development of systems of interaction, it also acts as an explanatory piece that shows how to properly formulate and interpret ideas relating to this sub-specialty. In addition to reviewing some basic principles of the study of regional interaction, Johnson highlights some novel ways of thinking about state formation, the growth of certain sites over others, and the development of hierarchies. These ideas all fit within the framework that he develops throughout the article, building upon examples that were mentioned earlier.\n\nComments\nK-Bish: Hello Zack! Thanks for providing an interesting review on archaeological theory. This is a topic I am less familiar with, and I am curious if you felt that Johnson’s work would be accessible to an audience that has a similar lack of background. I know that we had discussed the year of publish (1977) may have posed a problem for reviewing this article, but are any of these topics still applicable to your research today? Or, do you feel that most of what is discussed is no longer relevant in modern theory? I find that some older theory papers provide an interesting approach to utilizing new theoretical models. By looking at how drastic they may have changed, or what the major changes are we can map the changing paradigms or utilize different approaches. Overall do you feel that Johnson had a take-home message, or a ‘so what’ statement? I find this the hardest aspect of writing a review and I am curious how he approached it. Thanks for sharing!\nZack: I definitely think that this review is accessible to a wider audience. It starts off broad, and expands to cover more specialized issues. Although it is not stated as such in the abstract, I think that the prime ‘purpose’ of this article is to review how the basic principles we start off are applied, and how these base variables affect archaeological discussions that result. I do think that this is very useful today, since regional analysis is still quite dependant on assumptions (regarding human decision making, minimization/maximization/optimization, measurement of distance/effort/time, etc) that influence what we choose to be base variables. Of course, new developments have occurred since 1977, and new models should be reviewed, but the critical engagement presented in this text should be kept in mind.\nAnnabelle: Interesting review! It seems the article is very method based. I was curious if it went back in time and explained the early theories then followed the evolution of theoretical thinking or did it restrict itself to the theories of the moment. For example, my review article restricted itself to explaining concepts and ideas from the previous 20 years only. Also, since the article is quite old, do you think a new review article is necessary on this topic? Although the article I chose was fairly old too I know of many other authors and journals that have since published papers talking about evolution of theory and changes in the discipline.\nZack: The review was fairly focused on method, and the way I see it the examination of gravity models was used in order to break down the variables considered. Gravity models were being borrowed from Geographers at the time, and they are used today in archaeology to a very limited extent. This review was definitely written considering contemporary issues of the time, making frequent references to Hodder and Orton’s ‘Spatial Analysis in Archaeology’ that was published a year earlier. This review isn’t so much an overview of recent developments as a critical engagement with contemporary thinking regarding spatial analysis in archaeology.\nJonathan: Hey Zack, As per our discussions when I drop by your office unannounced, I know little about population analysis, but im pleased you think this piece of theory is accessible to the layman. Do you think you could expand a bit about gravity models and how they push the analyser to reconsider or at least confirm that the variables they are using are appropriate.\nAndy: Hi Zack, You may want to search out the legacy of this older “Annual Review of Anthropology” article. What has the legacy of this review been? How is it being cited in general? In the last 10 year? In the last 5? And what are the key words for those using this article? It is a very useful way to see how successful the issues have been, and how the areas of interest have morphed in recent years. (Perhaps a more recent article has been written, but “framed” differently, using different terms of engagement?) This would also be interesting as Johnson says on his very first page that he has assumptions about human decision making and spatial practices (energy minimization, etc) that archaeology (and particularly Hodder) has critiqued in recent decades.\ndillanejb: Hey Zack, I enjoyed your review. A lot has changed, particularily in the field of spatial analysis, since this article was written. Given your own interest in the technological, I would be very interested to know how you think the technological innovations of the last thirty years have impacted this kind of research. Has that impacted on the themes Johnson discusses?"

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis semester I enrolled in a writing course called Writing the Field taught by Dr. Andy Roddick, and I am very excited about it. I hope to gain more confidence in my writing, and be able to convey the thoughts in my head more clearly. In addition to working on a piece of writing throughout the semester, one of the requirements is to maintain a blog. Since I already have one I’ll be writing the required posts here, in addition to my regular ramblings. Here is an overview of what I’ll be writing about:\n\nYour writing workflow: a blog post on your writing process and a reflection of what slows you down, or where writer’s block emerges.\nAn outline: a basic outline of the writing you wish to complete this semester.\nReview of a “Reviews in Anthropology” article: find an article pertinent to your work and analyze the strengths of the literature review.\nKnowing your audience and recognizing the skeleton of written work: annotations of three articles in three anthropological journals.\nThe good and the bad: discussion of what makes articles fail and succeed by looking at an excellent article and a weak one.\nReview of a good presentation: within the department, at a conference, or from a youtube link.\n\nI think blogging is a great medium for a course like this. Blogging can help students gain confidence in their writing abilities, formulate ideas that can be shared and discussed, balance the formality of academic writing, and develop a presence among peers. I find that blogging is easier to do than writing a formal piece, as I tend to consider blogging more “active”. I want this view to change. Both blogging and “formal” academic writing should be considered active, and these lessons just described should be applied to any piece of work. By the end of the course I hope I’ll be able to apply my current mindset regarding blogging to other forms of writing as well."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis past weekend I travelled to New York with my parents to visit my sister for part of my reading break. It was kind of last minute but I had a great time. I spent most of my time by myself, which is alright because I love wandering big cities alone. I like exploring at my own pace, seeing the people go by and being a part of it.\nOn the first day I went to the American Museum of Natural History, and I was actually quite disappointed. There were dozens of little kids screaming in the halls and I instantly got a headache. Many of the exhibits echo like mad so that only made it worse. In fact, I found that the building was really run down and that the exhibits were all spatially confusing. I couldn’t stay for too long because I was so fed up, and my expectations were so much higher.\nBut the next day I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and it was amazing! This was one of the best museums I’ve been to. I spent a lot of time in the Egyptian exhibit, as well as the one displaying artifacts of North and South America, Australia and the Pacific islands. One piece that really stood out to me was a stone sphinx which was carved meticulously out of stone. The veins of the stone perfectly match up to the shape of every curve, which is extraordinary.\nI also got to see a friend from the field school I was working at this summer. Gideon goes to Columbia, studying evolutionary biology, and I got to see some of the campus. I also went to the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, who offer a PhD. program at NYU. There were no exhibitions going on at the time but I got to ask questions about the program and it’s a definite possibility that I will apply there after my Masters.\nAlso, I got into the Master of Museum Studies program at University of Toronto so I’m very excited about that. I’m really interested in the prospect of working in a museum, and I’m seriously considering going this route. Seeing the MET in New York really inspired me to go in this direction."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\nLast week I wrote a short essay on the Mycenaean redistribution system, mainly focused on the palace at Pylos. I realized that I did not know enough about the palatial administration in order to start focusing on the meat of my project, so this is mainly to provide background. Keep in mind that this is not that detailed, and that I did not have too much time for this since I was spending time with family because of religious holidays last week. But even though I didn’t write this out in great detail I still learned a lot about the palatial administration, which was the main goal of this assignment.\nFor further reading I plan to read Karl Polanyi’s book Trade and Markets in Early Empires (1957), and the works of other authors that I stumbled upon while doing this such as Killen, Halstead, Wright among others."

    "section": "The Mycenaean Palatial Redistribution System at Pylos",
    "text": "The Mycenaean Palatial Redistribution System at Pylos\nThe Mycenaean palaces are commonly viewed as economic centres, where raw materials, finished products, and allocations of land were recorded and redistributed among members of the palace and also among the. The damos were local communities that were ultimately under control of the palace (Shelmerdine, Bennet, and Preston 2008: 300-301). This model of redistribution has been studied primarily by looking at the administrative records, in the form of clay tablets bearing inscriptions written in the language referred to as Linear B. These documents recorded the flow of resources received by the palace, the process of turning these resources into manufactured goods by specialized workers, and the subsequent selective sharing of the finished products among the members of the community, among other economic concerns. Essentially, resources were pooled by a central authority, and then redistributed to others. This economic model was described and made popular by the economic anthropologist and philosopher Karl Polanyi, described this redistribution process from a cross-cultural perpective, and it has had significant influence on scholars in many disciplines (Polanyi 1971).\nPolanyi’s model of redistribution was intentionally broad, so that it could apply to multiple contexts. It can even be argued that 21st century Canada follows a redistributive system in a sense. There is no doubt that the Mycenaean palace of Pylos conducted this sort of economic activity, but it is up to modern scholars to differentiate how Mycenaeans at Pylos mobilized and shared resources compared to how other societies managed their respective commodities. Nakassis, Parkinson, and Galaty (2011: 180) put it best:\n\nIndeed, the purpose of the concept of redistribution for Polanyi and his students was to allow them to investigate the differences between different redistributive systems, embedded as they were in society at large, not to construct a monolithic model of “redistribution” and apply it wholesale to different historical contexts. That is, we ought not to be discussing whether a given society is redistributive or not, but how it is redistributive.\n\nThis is a very important point, and discussing redistribution without a description of the particular context in which the concept is described, can result in misinterpretation. Redistribution need not only refer to an economic system associated with a particular era, but it can be used to described social events in history as well. For example, one topic of personal interest is about commemorative and ritual feasts involve consuming large amounts of resources, and these too can be viewed as a form of redistribution (Nakassis, Parkinson, and Galaty 2011: 181).\nThere seem to be two main entities that constitute the Mycenaean economic organization: the palace and the damos. The palace is often viewed by historians and Aegeanists as the central economic hub of a region, and was the domain of the ruler, known as the wanax. The damos, on the other hand, were local communities that were run on a day-to-day basis by local people, but they were influenced by the palace. In Messenia, the region under control of the palace of Pylos, there were 16 damos that were mentioned in the tablets, which were divided into two provinces. As inferred by the Pylian tablets, Ke-ke-me-na land was considered to be controlled by the damos, and Ki-ti-me-na land was under the control of the _wanax_or his kin (Shelmerdine, Bennet, and Preston 2008: 74-75). Since ki-ti-me-na land was operated by the palace, resources generated by it were distributed to palace residents and those close to the wanax. Land owned and operated by the damos (ke-ke-me-na) was still indirectly restricted by the palace. The damos were taxed on important commodities and the distribution of ke-ke-me-na land among the elite members of the damos was controlled by the palace. Thus, the wanax could reward certain smaller communities by lowering taxes, and grant more land to individuals who supported him.\nWe can clearly see that the palace and the damos were formally separate entities, but that the former still maintained a controlling influence over the latter. The palace was obviously in a position to manipulate markets and costs in the _damos _to its own advantage. The _wanax_used this power to solidify his rule by distributing land among his followers and rewarding those in his favour. However, it is noteworthy that not all of the land in Messenia was recorded in the Pylian tablets, so the historical picture as documented in the written records is incomplete. Lupack (2011: 213-214) suggests that there were large tracts of untaxed land that is not accounted for, and even proposes that the religious sphere held its own land, independent of the palace. So, it is at least possible that the wanax did not control all of the damos.\nSome industries were heavily controlled by the palace, and the entire process from harvest of raw materials into their manufacture into finished products was duly recorded. Schon (2011) provides an overview of three such industries, showing exactly how much control the palace had over them.\nThe palace also employed the ta-ra-si-ja system to influence certain industries. Using this system, resources were allocated to craftsmen to make a finished product, which would be distributed by the palace. Killen (2001) noticed that this system was used mainly under certain circumstances: in decentralized industries, industries that only required one raw material, and industries that employed low-level workers.\nThe administrative system of the Mycenaean states, was evidently organized, yet there seems to be a lack of standardization in regards to the management and mobilization of resources (Schon 2011: 220). As noted, even though the damos were somewhat autonomous, the palace and the elite supporters of the wanax had a lot of control over the distribution of land and the manufacture of finished goods. However, it is very important to note that the evidence used to study the redistribution systems of the bronze age Aegean are limited, and many things that were not recorded by the palace scribes remain unaccounted for.  Additionally, the research concerning the economic administration at Pylos can not necessarily be applied to other territories on mainland Greece since there were almost certainly regional differences. While I will use analyze the redistributive model using network analysis in my thesis, I remain aware of its limitations and of the need to place it in context."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past few days I’ve been experimenting with Scrivener, an organizational tool for people who write essays, screenplays, or other lengthy papers. Usually academics use traditional word processors such as Microsoft Word, LibreOffice or Apple Pages, but Scrivener can hardly fit into the same category. Instead of focusing on content creation, Scrivener’s main appeal is its ability to help you organize your thoughts and rearrange a paper so everything fits the way you like it.\nWhat I especially like about this software is that it appeals to visual learners like myself. Sometimes when I’m facing a wall of text I just think to myself: what the hell should I do now? With Scrivener, the user interacts with the content in a special way that gets the author more involved with whatever project he or she is working on. It reminds me of my desk at home. It’s what I like to call an organized mess, and even though everything is jumbled around all over the place I know where everything is. Just don’t move anything around or the whole system will be ruined!\nOne thing that I’ll have to get used to is writing in short sections. I guess “switching fatigue” is to be expected since I’m so used to the old setup of having an infinite supply of pages, one after the other. This reminds me of the way that Dr. Graham taught The Historian’s Craft when I took it last year. He would punctuate class time into “mental health breaks” when we could discuss the lecture, talk with one another or just goof off. I’m not sure if he was just speculating or if there’s actually anything behind this, but his reasoning is that every way we consume content is separated into sections by commercial breaks, or it’s within their very natures (think blog posts, tweets, headlines, youtube clips, etc…). It’s about time that this trend of perforating consumable content reached the ways that we write papers.\nAnyways, I’ve been fiddling around and creating index cards in Scrivener. This is helping me get my thoughts organized. I’m still coming up with a basic outline for my thesis, but I’ll post it when I feel it’s focused enough. Expect it soon.\n\nComments\nShawn Graham: Hi Zack. My reasoning for mental health breaks — it all has to do with attention span. But that is indeed related to the way blog posts, tweets etc are written: short sharp focused (ideally) thought-units, which maps very nicely to the way Scrivener lays out the writing process."

If anyone from class is still receiving updates, feel free to leave comments. This first post corresponds with Week 10 in the syllabus: Landscapes of Movement: Roads & Pilgrimmage, and the papers are as follows:\n\nArdren, Traci and Justin Lowry (2011): The Travels of Maya Merchants in the Ninth And Tenth Centuries AD: Investigations at Xuenkal and the Greater Cupul Province, Yucatan, Mexico. World Archaeology 43(3):428-443.\nSorge, Antonio and Roddick, Andrew P. (2012) Mobile Humanity: The Delocalization of Anthropological Research. Reviews in Anthropolog 41(4): 273-301.\nUr, Jason A (2009) Emergent landscapes of movement in early Bronze Age northern Mesopotamia. In Snead, J.E.. Erickson C.L. and Darling J.A. (Eds.) Landscapes of Movement: Paths, Trails, and Roads in Anthropological Perspective, pp. 180- 203. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.\n\nArdren and Lowry examined the physical geography, as modified through human activity (i.e. the construction of cities, settlements and monuments), and modelled the movements of a merchant bringing goods from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico to Chichen Itza, a major Mayan capital city. Their aim was to reconstruct the travels of Mayan traders, and their work seems to have consisted of tracing merchants’ likely itineraries (including likely routes taken and their corresponding timing), and comparison of the observable archaeological record with their presumed behaviours. What is interesting about this paper is how the authors attempted to account for the limitations and motivations experienced and considered by a merchant — by imagining these factors from a first person perspective. I do note some limitations, however. First of all, it is presumed that all merchants had the same motivations and experiences. This renders the agentic aspect of the first person perspective completely moot, since the discussion is reoriented towards the examination of mercantile behaviour as an institution rather than as collective activities. Additionally, the authors presume that a trader’s primary goal was to reach Chichen Itza from Isla Cerritos along a direct and optimized trajectory. The mapped trajectory makes sense within the bounded survey region, but there may have also been other potentially rewarding target markets to visit outside of this arbitrarily defined tract. The authors also presume that each merchant was acting in a freelance and competitive manner, and were guided by rewards offered by buyers in the capital. Must large monumental mounds necessarily represent gravitational centres? Essentially, I find that the authors take on the sensory perspective of the trader, and yet primarily consider the motivations of elites situated in the capital. Alternatively, there may have been more value for merchants in maintaining cooperative relationships with other traders inhabiting the region, as well as with the inhabitants of settlements surrounding the capital. Their familiarity with the environments that they traversed suggests that merchants were locals to the area, and that the distributions of artefacts originating from the coastal ports may not have been the result of explicit mercantile behaviour, but as a buildup of social relationships (i.e. relationships that are not explicitly defined in economic terms) among members of various inland communities.\nUr’s paper seems to be more straightforward. The author identified trails left behind through repetitive and concentrated activity, and interpreted their orientations as the routes between fields that cattle herders would follow before arriving at open grazing areas. Since farmers used tracts of land located just outside the city, the movements of cattle had to be guided between fields in order to avoid trampling on crops. The points where the trails end thus demarcate borders of fields, where cattle then spread out to pasture. Ur notes that these borders can be used to estimate population densities and to better understand the subsistence economy in this archaeological setting. This seems like a very solid study, and the vast number of sites exhibiting these trails poses interesting potential for comparison among them. However there is still the risk of generalizing the local economies at each site when conducting such multi-site studies, and it is important to recognize variability through assessment of each site as a whole before drawing comparisons among them.\nAs Sorge and Roddick point out, it is quite difficult to recognize peoples’ individuality when looking towards the deep past. I also imagine that it would be difficult to broaden ones’ understanding of a person and generalize their behaviour among others in his or her community. At what point is it acceptable or not acceptable to ascribe highly similar motivations and behaviours to unacknowledged members of a community based upon focused observations of a single member, and vice versa regarding the characterization of an individual based upon an understanding of collective action? In multi-site analysis this assumption that “sites” equal their inhabitants is extremely prevalent. In an ideal world, dynamic processes within sites should be considered to a greater extent when examining interactions between them. However this may also be very impractical. Assuming that a common goal of multi-site studies is to reconstruct past behaviours, it may be downright impossible, since any such model can never reach perfect resolution relative to the archaeological phenomena being examined.\nOne other striking note I made, perhaps while implicitly comparing the work of Ardren and Lowry (2011) and Ur (2009), is that the landscape itself should not be the focus of study. Instead, I believe that it might be better to evaluate how people physically coped with, altered, or interacted with the landscape as a material. This latter approach is better poised to reconstruct human behaviours and the rationales behind them based upon assessments grounded in physical evidence, rather than attempts of estimating the perceptions of generalized individuals through largely cognitive assessments. I believe that this point is illustrated in other work discussed throughout this class as well; for instance, Joyce’s (2004) and Pauketat and Alt’s (2005) applications of historical processualism are exemplary of the former approach, and Van Dyke’s (2008) and Fowles’ (2009) phenomenological observations pertain to the latter. Whereas Ur (2009) was concerned with the physical transformation of the landscape in response to human activities, Ardren and Lowry’s (2011) work was based upon presumed understandings of ways by which environments were perceived by those exhibiting generalized and easily predictable behaviour, and how these perceived landscapes might have influenced peoples’ behaviour.\n\nComments\nAndy: Hi Zack, Three quick (if broad) questions: Assuming that a common goal of multi-site studies is to reconstruct past behaviours… What is the common goal? Could you extract that from our (sometimes convoluted!) discussion? Was Ur’s paper straightforward? Certainly his method was, but I wonder if his actual approach was. I thought this was a rather elegant analysis. Is he simply looking at the physical response to human activities? Doesn’t he include some phenomenological aspects of the rulers movements through the landscape as well?\nZack: I agree that Ur’s paper was elegant, and his commentary on the imposition of certain behaviours relating to inter-settlement travel from the bottom-up was especially interesting. The responses to the physical landscape are what stood out to me since this seems like the most practical way of conducting landscape archaeology in prehistoric contexts. I think that Ur’s evocation of the travelling elite definitely serves to reinforce a particular view of socio-politics in this setting, however it is reliant on certain assumptions gained from textual sources that are not readily available in most other prehistoric archaeological contexts.\nI guess the goals of archaeologists conducting multi-sited studies differ according to their research questions. Ur’s goal was to leverage the northern Mesopotamian trail system in order to better understand the roles of elites and of commoners in that society. Ardren and Lowry aimed to re-model past economic processes by predicting “common sense” behaviours. Ardren and Lowry had a pre-conceived idea of the role of the merchant in society, and this conception guided their dataset and analysis from the top-down. On the other hand, Ur depicted a way of better understanding social issues by re-imagining peoples’ experiences. Although Ur’s study was more so based on a bottom-up approach, he was still constructing a model; whereas the features of his model (imagined experiences, phenomenology) are largely grounded in theory, whereas Ardren and Lowry used distance and artefact counts instead. In this sense, the problems of generalization and presumption persists. However I do see that it is relatively simple and easy to reconstruct certain generalized behaviours based on physical geography, but that it is often much more fulfilling to assess peoples’ experiences and relationships through application of social theory."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been hearing bits and pieces about a concept called the anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch that marks the span in which humans have substantially impacted the environment. According to wikipedia the term was coined in the mid 1980s, but it seems to have caught on among geologists and climate scientists in light of all the evidence pointing towards human involvement in global warming and climate change. While we can definitely say that we live in the anthropocene today, the beginning point of this era is open-ended. There are those who believe that the anthropocene began during the mid 19th century with european industrialization, but other stances assert that the starting point should be pushed back 2000 years ago under the reasoning that some of the largest empires recognized by climate scientists sprang up around this time, or even 15,000 years ago when humans began to dabble with plant domestication and the construction of architecture. Arguments can be made to some degree for all of these propositions, but what I’m really peeved about is the fact that no archaeologists, anthropologists, historians or classicists are getting substantially involved. \nLast week an article was published in the newly minted journal The Anthropocene Review titled The technofossil record of humans. Here’s the abstract:\n\nAs humans have colonised and modified the Earth’s surface, they have developed progressively more sophisticated tools and technologies. These underpin a new kind of stratigraphy, that we term technostratigraphy, marked by the geologically accelerated evolution and diversification of technofossils –– the preservable material remains of the technosphere (Haff 2014), driven by human purpose and transmitted cultural memory, and with the dynamics of an emergent system. The technosphere, present in some form for most of the Quaternary, shows several thresholds. Its expansion and transcontinental synchronisation in the mid 20th century has produced a global technostratigraphy that combines very high time-resolution, great geometrical complexity and wide (including transplanetary) extent. Technostratigraphy can help characterise the deposits of a potential Anthropocene Epoch and its emergence marks a step change in planetary mode.\n\nTo any archaeologists this may seem a bit bizarro. It seems like the authors are simply switching out terms for ones that fit a common theme. Here’s a breakdown:\nTechnofossil = Artefact\nTechnostratigraphy = Assemblage\nTechnosphere = Society\n\nWhile I am not against the integration of archaeological perspectives within geologic- or atmospheric-based research, I am a bit amazed that the authors of this paper aren’t aware of much of the effort to investigate human-landscape interaction in the social sciences over the last few decades. I’m pretty sure the main participants in the anthropocene discussion are geologists, palaeontologists or climate scientists whose primary focus is the environment itself, but when discussing human processes that may have had a substantial impact don’t you think it would be wise to call upon the already-extensive base of knowledge devised by specialists devoted to this field of research?\nBut what about the lack of effort made by archaeologists? We complain about hyper-specialization, lack of public engagement and troubles on the job market, but here is a new field wanting to implement the ideas that we take for granted. Not only can we introduce a fresh perspective to this emerging field, but this kind of research is actually on people’s minds. News about climate change, including evidence for it in antiquity, is all over the place, reported by major outlets and smaller blogs alike. There may even be potential for archaeological research to be cited in parliamentary debates!\nEssentially, what I’m saying is that there are reasons to involve archaeological research in discussions surrounding the anthropocene that would benefit all parties. Moreover, what’s stopping classicists or historians from getting involved as well? Why not try to establish ourselves more firmly in other fields of research that touches upon our own?"

I am happy to say that the fermentation is complete, and I finally got to taste it. It’s probably the fact that I played an active role in the process, but it tastes really great. It is sweet, since I added honey and other spices, and it is better served chilled.\n\nMainly because of time constraints, I did not get to re-create Bronze Age Aegean wine in a very authentic way, as I had hoped. I did not get a hold of an unslipped ceramic pithos, which would have allowed me to coat the inside with pine pitch. Also, I could not use fresh grapes and leave them to dry in the sun for weeks at a time since I started this project in November. Admittedly there was a lot of hype going into this at the beginning and sadly the wine is not as authentic as I would like. However, I consider this the first batch of many, and I hope to get closer to my goal next time.\nIn fact, I am working on a PERT chart in order to determine what exactly would have to be done in order for a proper recreation to be made. I will be able to see exactly what I need in order to get it right next time. Since I have a lot on my plate right now, expect this to be done by approximately the 20th of December. Of course, I’ll post it on this blog.\nI’d like to extend my gratitude to Jasen Ananny at the Wine Station, who helped me with this project and let me use his facilities and equipment. Him and his staff were extremely helpful, and gave me tons of advice. If anyone has any questions about home winemaking or brewing, I suggest you get in contact with him and he would be glad to help.\nI think that this kind of hands-on experience is the most exciting kind of learning. Even though this batch is not perfect, I will work on another one that builds on it at the next grape harvest. Cheers!"

In order to examine the relationship between wine and social structure in the Bronze Age Aegean, I’m going to be using network analysis to trace the flow of commodities (notably wine, grapes and other related products) throughout the region. I’m also going to look at drinking vessels, analyzing the vessel types, their origins, and the residues that may have been left behind. I will also include a look at Homeric feasting scenes.\nIt’s good that I now have a clear goal of what data I need to attain, and how to do it. It really looks like this project is shaping together at last. But I still have to go one step at a time. I have to start by defining some basic assumptions about my topic in order to understand the context that I will be writing about. So for next week I’m going to try to determine how the governing body of the Mycenaean citadels functioned, and whether it was loosely composed of a “nexus of social relationships”, as Dr. Graham put it, or if it has a more concrete structure. I’ll post my thoughts on that once I have it finished."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis week I was assigned to blog about the article written by Joyce, Unintended Consequences? Monumentality as a Novel Experience in Formative Mesoamerica, which reevaluates the circumstances that may have led to the construction of monuments during the Formative Period in Mesoamerica. Joyce illustrates how the first clay platforms were constructed using knowledge from prior experience working with the same materials, and speculates on how they were perceived by those who lived alongside them when they were first built. She dismisses the idea that monuments were built for their own sake, and instead proposes that the notable platforms were the result of normal practices used when constructing houses upon the site of a preceding structure. The larger surface area in which the clay was laid out resulted in extended longevity for the structure and social differentiation for people associated with it via phenomenological control and access restrictions.\nJoyce draws on the work of (giddens1977?) in order to highlight the role of already existing structure and practices in shaping new socio-political developments. The author guides us through a scenario in which an actor would initiate the construction of a grand monument in an explicitly intentional manner, which is shown to be not that realistic. Instead, Joyce proposes that the permanence of these platforms results from similar practices as before, albeit performed under different circumstances, namely the application of clay onto a wider and flatter surface. This means that the mobilization of labour would have likely occurred within the already-existing social structure featuring already-existing practices.\nHowever what if the social structure of the status quo (prior to “monumental” platforms) was already of a manner that would have favoured socio-political control or the restriction of specialized knowledge? Although the readings this week emphasized the relationships between place and power, at times I felt that place was given too much attention as a way of solidifying control. Monuments and control of special places are useful in that regard, however what about the role of clothing, jewelry, or other alienable or inalienable possessions? And what about restricted knowledge or practices? If some form of social influence was already in effect then the unlikely scenario posed by Joyce, in which an actor somehow convinces her community to drop everything and build a monument, may contain some credibility after all. However a solid rebuttal to this counter-argument is that these things may all be associated with certain places (i.e. raw materials come from a certain place; knowledge is often inspired by nature, which occurs at a place), and that social differentiation is derived from control over the thing’s use, which may be best accomplished through control of the places from which the things may be derived. So it seems that I’ve come full circle (… I think) and ultimately I’m a bit confused after writing out this post. Maybe after thinking about this some more, and reading some of the comments, I’ll update with further thoughts.\nUPDATE: Following Dr. Roddick’s prompts, I re-read Joyce’s article with more attention paid to the high theory involved. The author clearly draws from Giddens’ duality of structure and agency, a theoretical pillar that recognizes the roles of individual agents in the reproduction and transformation of social structure that in turn feedbacks into the actions of individuals. At the core of Giddens’ work is his appreciation of the role of individual human agents in shaping social structure through persistence or repetition of certain cultural practices, rather than characterizing societies based on the institutions in place. Giddens draws an analogy to languages to explain his ideas in a more relatable way; language is simply and effectively the encryption and decryption of information by parties with a mutual understanding of the meanings behind words and letters, and the “rules” for processing information are rather implicit to those communicating. As with social structure, the rules of transferring information or ways of acting are implicit in our minds, however they are loosely defined based on the behaviour of others in the collective. As people tend to view the world differently and interact in different ways, languages and social protocol shift as well. The actions of and interactions between individuals thus shape the overall social structure, yet actors are concurrently influenced by this worldview that they shape. The implicit nature of protocols that shape social structure suggests a degree of un-inentionality in the actions of agents, an issue that came up when characterizing agency in class, albeit briefly in preparation for a more in-depth discussion later on.\nJoyce tied in structuration theory after recognizing that the construction of later monumental platforms could have been derived from practices already in place prior to the explicit intention of building monuments. The phenomenological changes that arose from the construction of certain larger platforms would have occurred unintentionally, rather than as a result of intentional motivations to build a monument. While I don’t claim to have any  knowledge regarding phenomenology, I think that the cognitive changes that drove these societal shifts need to be made more explicit, and that discussion on transformation itself remains the weakest link in Joyce’s argument. Although the author does refer to Love’s work (published a 1999 volume co-edited by Joyce), I have not had the chance to read this yet.\nJoyce recognizes that social structure is a product of individuals’ actions, and that peoples’ actions — which are often unintentionally driven — are the result of social pressures. At the surface this seems kind of cyclical, but it does seem to make sense. I just feel that we need to be able to map the processes involved in these transformations better, and perhaps formalize the way that Giddens’ structuration theory is applied.\nAbout Rosemary Joyce: Rosemary Joyce is an anthropological archaeologist at UC Berkeley, and is a leading figure in the field of social archaeology. Her work focuses on ceramic analysis, household archaeology, and the archaeology of sex and gender, but these interests seem to stem out into other related fields as well. Joyce has a blog, Ancient Bodies, Ancient Lives, where she reflects on perceptions of sex and gender of the past as portrayed in contemporary media and archaeology news reports, providing a more informed perspective for the general public in amazingly accessible language and format.\n\nComments\nAndy: Hi Zack, Maybe I can make a suggestion here? Perhaps you (and with the help of others) can dig into the key “big question” of the article, the high theory if you will, which revolves around the idea of structuration vis-a-vis bigger debates around structure: agency. Perhaps give us a bit more on structuration. Of course we briefly introduced the notion of agency last week. Perhaps we can work towards the nitty gritty of Gidden’s idea, and how Joyce is using this to help understand agency and structure in the context of early sites in Mesoamerica. What is Joyce’s view on those troubling issues of “intention” and agency as individuals, which we also discussed last week in our introduction to agency. Then turn to think through the how this is explored in the archaeological data. In other words, go from the “high theory” to the nuts and bolts of the case study.\nAlex: After reading your update, I felt like I had a better grasp of the way Joyce links the theoretical idea of structuration and agency to the example of monumentality in Formative Mesoamerica. Specifically, I liked your comment that “the cognitive changes that drove these societal shifts need to be made more explicit, and that discussion on transformation itself remains the weakest link in Joyce’s argument.” Though I understand your point that such a link presents a weakness in Joyce’s argument, I think we could give her more credit. Taken as a hypothetical, Joyce’s claim that early “monumental” platforms caused a phenomenological shift through unintended consequences can be useful to us as a mode of investigation.\nLet me try to be a little more clear. I think that the strongest aspect of Joyce’s essay was her refusal to accept explanations for early monumental platforms based in our contemporary perception of monumentality today. Instead, by focusing on the unintended consequences of building these platforms, she forces us to rethink the beginnings of monumentality outside of a presentist view. I find such an investigative strategy intellectually courageous and admirable. And despite the empirical strength of her claim, I feel her strategy alone is significant.\nAndy: Very nicely put. Another way to say it, is that Joyce is concerned with “looking up” through time, rather than looking back. Many explanations for transformations are based heavily upon what emerged. In contrast, Joyce is interested in thinking through the materials, and previous experiences with those materials (in this case, clay), and the potential ripple effect they may have had. For instance, “new concept of architecture as something potentially more permanent may have shifted the way that residential structures were assessed, placing a greater value on permanency in those as well. At Puerto Escondido, for example, the use of lime plaster and stone facings becomes a feature of monumental earthen and of residential architecture simultaneously, with the earliest plastered platforms platforms dating to 1100-900 B.C. Prior to that point, our construction evidence suggests buildings with post frameworks supported perishable superstructures, and these buildings were remodeled many times in succession.” (p. 19). We can actually think of architecture that’s still with us today in a similar fashion. For instance, does anyone know the story behind front porches in North America?\nAndy: …and thanks Zack for the update — we’ll definitely explore this in more detail tomorrow!"

I’m learning that Github is a great venue for hosting text-based datasets and disseminating preliminary results in a comfortable way.\nI’ve always been an advocate for open access to data and I had considered various options for storing and disseminating the database that I am constructing for my Master’s thesis. I really like text-based solutions since they are easy to modify across virtually any platform, they are easily convertible to more complex file formats, and there is a general air of simplicity when working with them. (I now use TextEdit as my primary word processor, switching over to word only whenever I need to do some advanced formatting or track changes.) Now, while I am using FileMaker to enter my data and Excel as a file-conversion intermediary, I am working on transforming my dataset to JSON and its spinoff dialects, geoJSON and bibJSON in particular. JSON is readable by both humans and computers, enabling easy modifications and additions of new data, with versatile ways of displaying and disseminating the information being stored.\nGithub makes it very easy to read JSON and many other text-based file formats, including tabular data files. Github has even integrated the Leaflet mapping tool so geoJSON data can be perused cartographically. I also like Github because it generates stable links for easy sharing, my data can be used by others with similar or widely different goals, and the effort that I put into the collation of this data can be fully recognized, and even expanded upon. However, Github was never intended to be a database-sharing platform and there are some limitations for this kind of use. It would be great if bibliographic entries could be generated so others can cite my work appropriately. Additionally, an option for some form of storage designed for longevity would better suit the goals of academics. Maybe there will be a push in this direction now that PLOS has updated their open data policy.\nI’ve also started to push some of my preliminary analyses to Github as I work on them. Working transparently definitely impacts my mindset since I am encouraged to produce more meaningful results, stay organized, and participate with others doing similar things. I get to show off a bit too, extending my visibility to people at a distance. However saying something meaningful about the results I obtain is the other side of the coin that I must not forget about.\nIn general, I think this is a good direction for me. It feels great to get my work out there, even in an incomplete state."

    "text": "Brughmans (2010)\nThis paper presents network analysis as a flexible set of analytical tools that can be applied to explore a variety of archaeological topics, while rejecting the notion that network analysis methods can be applied as a standardized, ‘cookie-cutter’ set of practices. Brughmans touches on some major issues surrounding the use of network analysis by archaeologists, and strongly suggests that archaeologists should carefully consider the issues and subsequent ramifications on interpretation when applying network analysis to their research. These issues that Brughmans suggests archaeologists of this sub-specialty should consider are:\n\nThe role of archaeological data in networks\nThe diversity of network structures, their consequences and their interpretation\nThe critical use of quantitative tools\nThe inﬂuence of other disciplines, especially sociology\n\nThe author evaluates recent studies that utilized network analysis methods to examine various topics of archaeological concern, and points towards the ways that each sought to answer the questions at hand. He does this by highlighting the nature of the data, how the analysis of said data was interpreted, the specific methods that were chosen to enlighten our understanding of the archaeological topic being examined, and whether the study was conducted with an archaeological framework in mind. Additionally, Brughmans conducts his own analysis as a case study, pointing towards his considerations of these issues as he formulates various conclusions. By looking closely at how archaeologists have dealt with these issues, which may be very implicit in some cases, Brughmans illustrates how network analysis can be tremendously useful, but only while suiting the analyses to the questions at hand.\nJust as a builder must examine a blueprint of the building he wishes to construct, understand the properties of the foundation he builds upon, and utilize the proper tools when appropriate, a network analyst must define the nature of the relationships he or she wishes to explore, understand which tools to use and what the ramifications will be, while keeping in mind the nature of the dataset. Brughmans shows that there are no standardized methods or modes of interpretation, and that network analysis must be done in light of the wider archaeological and contextual frameworks that surround the topic being researched. I am currently constructing an archaeological framework, reading about various archaeological topics that relate to what I am examining as part of my research (this is the focus of my literature review). This is also helping me more clearly define the relationships I will examine and how they can be drawn out of the data I will be using."

    "text": "Sindbæk (2007)\nIn this paper, Sindbæk examines the structure of communication and exchange networks in Viking Age Scandinavia by analysing the travels of Anskar as depicted in the Vita Anskarii, and by tracing a web of imported artefacts that is indicative of regional trade and interaction. This article also challenges the viability of two well-observed archaeological models regarding regional exchange (the down-the-line model and central place theory) by indicating how they conflict with models that explain the development of complex networks, such as the ones Sindbæk analyses. Sindbæk points out that the down-the-line model treats all sites as having equal opportunities for trade and exchange that is assumed to occur randomly among neighbouring sites. However recent observations on common properties of complex networks indicate that this kind of organization rarely occurs. Sindbæk also argues that central place theory is flawed since it assumes that certain sites will have eventually grown into the large urban centres that are evident today, which ignores the development process. A complex network approach, on the other hand, takes such dynamic processes into account.\nBy taking on a complex network theory approach and by utilizing network analysis methods, Sindbæk shows that networks based on both the travels of Anskar and the co-presence of imported artefacts form small-world systems with scale-free structures. That is, a few highly connected sites act as hubs that broker interactions between clusters of smaller, more sparsely connected sites. Interestingly, these two networks, which represent communication and exchange systems respectively, correspond with each other at various points. The author also utilizes his analyses to illustrate his concerns regarding the down-the-line model and central place theory.\nSindbæk’s article is a tremendously helpful analysis that has helped me develop some ideas for my own research. The identification of clusters that are evident in the network topology, which Sindbæk colour-coded and arranged by region, got me thinking more about the incorporation of geographical and economic aspects into my analyses. The discussions concerning the down-the-line model and central place theory were very insightful as well, however I am unsure about what kind of impact these arguments have had on the broader archaeological community. Also, whether it was intended or not, the analysis and discussion of Anskar’s travels and how this impacts our understanding of Viking Age communications systems really helped humanize the way I look at network analysis."

    "section": "Watkins (2008)",
    "text": "Watkins (2008)\nIn this article, Watkins recognizes that archaeologists still tend to identify ‘cultures’ based on the identification of similar artefact styles, and proposes an alternative, bottom-up approach to these inter-site similarities that become more evident during the Early Neolithic. The author asserts that as individual sites began to exchange materials and information, exhibiting the three modes of interaction as described in Renfrew’s model of peer-polity interaction (competition and competitive emulation, symbolic entrainment and the transmission of innovation, and increased flow in the exchange of goods), a broader ‘level’ of shared material culture and practices emerges.\nAlthough it is not made explicit, this point of view seems to be influenced by general systems theory. In essence, Watkins describes how multiple agents (communities) interact in such a way so that a deeper system emerges. This bottom-up approach, which views similar material culture or innovations as the product of developing interactions, holds potential to explain rather than simply describe the distribution of cultural assemblages. This article acts as a strong theoretical base that I must refer back to while conducting my own research on the emergence of broader systems in the same setting that Watkins examined.\n\nComments\nAndy: Hi Zack, Looks like you have found some very useful articles – and very up to date. You say, regarding the Sindbæk article, “I am unsure about what kind of impact these arguments have had on the broader archaeological community.” Google scholar says that 8 have cited this paper, and about half are viking scholars. However, one article that came up that is worth perusing, perhaps, is the 2012 chapter “Interactions in space for archaeological models” by TS Evans, RJ Rivers and our friend C Knappett. I wonder about that Watkins piece. It doesn’t sound all that theoretically sophisticated, and yet it is being cited quite often. I may have to take a gander at both this one and the very interesting Sindbæk myself! Did you find the annotation process useful to highlight areas of potential further interest. You say, “I am currently constructing an archaeological framework, reading about various archaeological topics that relate to what I am examining as part of my research” in the words of Luker, are you beginning to discover the “frames”? Can you articulate them\nZack: Hi Andy, thanks for commenting. I am indeed delving into my ‘frames’, as Luker would put it. I’ve been thinking a lot about the angles from which I want to approach, especially in light of Brughmans’ article above, and another review by him I read recently. I haven’t posted an outline yet because I’m having a hard time committing to what I have in mind at the moment, but I’ll have something up soon. Regarding the citations to Sindbaek’s article, after a quick scan I’ve noticed that most of the non-region-specific articles lack much engagement with his ideas or criticisms, and are rather superficial. I’m a bit surprised about this. Also, I’m familiar with the work of Evans, Rivers and Knappett from my undergraduate thesis work, but I should re-read it in light of some new understandings I’ve gained. The Watkins article was very enlightening. He gives a very different perspective, which is especially interesting for me since I’m in the midst of learning about this setting, and it’s still very fresh in my mind."

    "section": "November Write-Up for Honours Project",
    "text": "November Write-Up for Honours Project\nNetwork analysis is used to study the interactions of various entities, whether they are social connections, trade links, political hierarchies, or larger economic models. Rather than examining the attributive properties of each individual component, the relationships between them are the main focus. In the case of this project, I am examining the relationship between various Bronze Age archaeological sites in the Aegean, and the types of pottery that were used by their inhabitants.\nIn part I am modeling this project off of a similar paper by Tom Brughmans titled “Connecting the Dots: Towards Archaeological Network Analysis” (Brughmans 2010). Brughmans provides a model for making relational and spatial networks, and uses a case study to demonstrate how the distribution and co-presence of artifacts can be mapped on a network. He used data provided by Dr. Jeroen Poblome and Dr. Philip Bes of the Kathelieke Universiteit Leuven as part of the ICRATES platform, and was specifically working with Roman tableware.\nThe nature of the raw data is crucial to this kind of project. Brughmans used a pre-compiled database of pottery, assembled from dozens of sites around the Mediterranean, with input from the lead excavators. This can be very useful for Roman historians, however there is no such database of pottery available for scholars of the Aegean during the Bronze Age. It is up to individual researchers to assemble a collection of vessels and their properties, which can be a slow and arduous process.\nThe inconsistency of the data can be problematic, and I certainly ran into this problem while compiling the database of pottery. Researchers at different institutions in various settings may disagree on cataloging techniques, and the excavator’s decisions of what to include or not include when publishing his or her data can effect the theoretical research of scholars who may depend on the raw information. Many of the original excavation reports that I must examine can be up to 150 years old, and the information provided can be either incomplete or not up to date. Scholars that excavated long ago may have excluded some information from publication, assuming that it was irrelevant or unimportant, but did not realize that statistical and analytical methods could be employed to further our knowledge about the history of the site.\nAt first I started recording the properties of individual vessels that have been found during excavations. The type of vessel, its date, the slip, the fabric, and the decoration were the main attributes that were noted. It was my hope that I would be able to determine the level of luxury based on these three latter properties, however this would require me to take liberties beyond what is academically acceptable. Of course, determining the status of the vessels would only apply to those meant for serving and consumption of food and drinks, or other ceramics that would be displayed in a social setting. There would be little reason to decorate cooking vessels used for food preparation since there is little social significance involved with the “behind the scenes” domestic tasks.\nAnother major problem with this method that I now recognize is the disproportionate progress of excavations. Even if all of the pottery that has been found was recorded properly and consistently without any of the problems outlined above, excavations may still be ongoing and undisturbed deposits may still lie below the surface. The uneven representation of the archaeological record is something that must be taken into account when running these visualizations, and the prevalence of certain types of vessels should be understood with scrutiny.\nWith my former goal in mind, I compiled a database of the pottery included in the excavation reports of Palaikastro, Kommos and Kastri, all of which are situated on Crete. Recording the individual vessels for just these three sites took a very long time, mainly because of the problems with data entry that I mentioned above. Looking back, I realize that my biggest mistake was not properly defining what my goals were for this project. Brughmans (2010: 285) put it best:\n\nResearch aims will determine for the most part what networks are identified and explored in the data available. Although they are complex on their own, these networks will never cover the full complexity of an archaeological dataset. It therefore becomes crucial to define the nature of the components of a network, their relationships, the network itself, and the meaning of the procedure of every type of analysis from the outset. This is undoubtedly the most important stage in any network analysis, as one could calculate the structure of virtually any kind of relationship between data, but if we do not know what this structure and the resulting patterning represent any results will be meaningless.\n\nHowever, just to see what could be produced with the data that I already collected, I ran a visualization of what I had so far ((v4-new?)). Because each relationship between a site and an individual piece of pottery is accounted for, the edges between certain nodes were weighted more than others. My renewed opinion is that it is better to leave out the weights corresponding to prevalence of pottery types. We can still gather valuable results from viewing the distribution of certain vessels without the added weights, while maintaining a proper level of confidence.\n\nIn such a way, the visualization can be used to compare the co-presence of pottery types between archaeological sites throughout the Aegean, just as Brughmans did with Roman tableware. It is also possible to look at the adoption of certain types of vessels over time for a particular site. If done properly, links should be made that connect similar pottery types with periods immediately before and after each other. This can help us create dendograms depicting the typologies of ceramic vessels for a particular site. Then the dendograms can be compared with those of neighboring towns, and patterns of regionalism can be noted. This can even fit in with a larger network of the Aegean, with each region’s variation acting as a different module in a larger context. I think that this is an exciting prospect, and I am excited that this can fit into a broader context.\nAdditionally, it is possible to measure the betweeness centrality within a module representing a particular region, and if types with high values are also present outside of this specified area, we can determine the amount of contact that the region had with the rest of the Aegean. Perhaps this can be traced as a layer to the spatial network created by Carl Knappet, Tim Evans and Ray Rivers that mapped sailing routes in the Aegean (Knappett, Evans, and Rivers 2008). It would be very interesting to see whether or not the two networks compliment each other.\nNow that I have demonstrated what can be done in the near future, I’ll explain the results that have already been attained ((v5-new1?)). This network does not focus on a specific time period, but rather examines the site as a whole. Once more data is collected for various sites it will be possible to visualize shorter intervals. As expected, the modularity for this network suggests that there are three main groupings of pottery, each arranged around a particular archaeological site. However, at Kastri there seems to be no types of pottery that occur solely at that site. This is probably because of the incompleteness of the data and the unavailability of certain excavation reports. Once all of the data is available I’m sure the network will look quite different.\n\nThe betweeness centrality and other properties regarding path length do not seem to have any significance at this point, probably due to the rudimentary data. Since there are only three sites in the network, the maximum impact that a single node can have on the entire network is dependent on how many edges it has. Right now, the network is very simple, but as more data gets collected and input I imagine it will get much more complex and some interesting patterns might emerge. As I mentioned above, measuring the betweeness centrality can be very useful later on when examining the interaction between modules in a larger Aegean-wide context.\nClearly, the next steps for me to take should be to record more data so that it can be added to the network. Without working on this first step I cannot advance to the next. In order for me to do this I need to acquire these reports from the archaeological sites, which has been very troublesome so far. Many of these reports are not available at any libraries accessible to me, so I must loan them from universities in other cities.\nI am very eager to begin the interpretive phase of this project and start analyzing the results. There are many interesting things that can be done using network analysis, and I am seeing a lot of value in these methods. Hopefully all of these things outlined here can be incorporated into my honours project. Even if time acts as a constraint, perhaps I will complete these goals later on in my academic career."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAs an avid watcher of sci-fi, and as a student of antiquity, I like to think about how others view the past, the present and the future. Science fiction, which is often co-labelled as speculative fiction, is an avenue for presenting the author’s view of the world under different circumstances. A writer’s view of the future is shaped by his outlook on the world, his attitudes towards broader aspects of his culture, and his interpretation of the past. Similarly, historians write their histories from a certain perspective, which is built up by their own personal experiences, their cultural context, and the academic traditions that have sculpted their interests. I was speaking with a friend about the similarities between the production of science fiction and the study of antiquity, and I want to share some aspects of our discussion and the thoughts that spun off from it.\nL and I were discussing this side-project I’m working on that I’m really excited about. I want to write an epic story that occurs in a post-Iliad setting, along the same timeline as The Odyssey, The Aeneid, and the major dramas of the Classical Period of Greece. I also want to incorporate an archaeological spin, tying up the storyline to what is evident today in the archaeological record. I don’t want to reveal too much just yet, I’ll post some more about this later as it develops. The fact that people have been telling these epic stories for generations amazes me, as it’s a way of escaping the contemporary world and situating oneself with the legendary kings of the Aegean, the gods of Olympus, and the adventures that ensued. Among the citizens of Classical Athens, hearing The Iliad being recited must have given a very amazing take on the past; conflicts between polities, military commanders leading armies to war, long journeys interspersed with hazards and oddities along the way. Sounds a lot like Star Trek, doesn’t it?\nIt also gave ordinary citizens the ability to step into the shoes of the main characters. One could see how a great king would take control of his troops, deal with the interventions of the gods, and tackle the issues that lie in his way. Additionally, there are a few instances when the role of the individual citizen is examined. As an example, the common soldier Thersites, described as the ugliest man who came to Troy, criticized Agamemnon’s leadership and is exemplified as a fool for doing so. Battle scenes are also very illustrative as microcosms for everyday life. By depicting the actions of common men in a certain light, and highlighting possible consequences, these stories associate certain attitudes to various behaviours.\nNow, when retelling the innovations of the Classical Period in Athens, scholars base their views on generations of built-up attitudes towards these periods that have accumulated over centuries. We emphasize the roles of the major politicians and tyrants as if we fully understand their ultimate goals and their decision-making processes. However we only understand a certain aspect of their lives. By writing fictional accounts of these characters, with a strong base in our current understandings, we can explore different facets of their lives and consider how they would act in certain novel situations. The author can feel free to invent new characters, develop original story lines or even transpose an entire genre. The developments would reflect the author’s interpretations, and if I was writing I would try to base it in our current understandings as much as possible. I would experiment and see how our view, formed over 2000 years of experience in between, complements my own understanding of this character and of this setting.\nEssentially, you could call this fan fiction, and this is certainly not meant in a negative way. By repositioning our understanding of the past, and by extending our own perspectives in a creative, perhaps even playful way, it is possible to get a more real view on a setting of personal interest."

Admittedly I haven’t been writing as much as I should be, even just small thoughts. The absence of recent posts on my blog is evidence of this. Of course I have been keeping track of aspects of the excavation reports which I am using, but no penetrating thoughts have been developed during the past few weeks.

    "text": "The Good (Broodbank (1993))\nThis article is one of the first studies of regional interaction of the Cycladic Islands that utilized network analysis methods. Broodbank takes off from ideas presented in a previous publication, when he posited that a handful of major Neolithic centres were able to control maritime trade, taking advantage of their unique positions in the system of interaction. This paper attempts to identify these loci using Proximal Point Analysis (PPA), and explain how their position within trade networks may have contributed to their advancement.\nRight off the bat, Broodbank quotes Mary Helms’ (1988) Ulysses’ Sail, and opens up a discussion on the construction of value. In particular, there is a focus on the transmission of knowledge as a source of power, a topic which is referred to throughout the text and acts as a basis for the author’s arguments. The use of theory is not compartmentalized, and is utilized comprehensively to construct the author’s arguments. At the same time, Broodbank uses solid methods that scaffold the theory. However, Knappett, Evans, and Rivers (2008) have briefly critiqued Broodbank’s use of PPA and suggest that alternative models (namely a gravity model) may be better suited for similar research.\nI also like how Broodbank asks many questions. Some are hypothetical, the answers to which are only understood at a later point in the text, and some are answered right away. In all cases, they make the reader think about what it is Broodbank is searching for. They re-frame the reader in the same light as the author, and reposition the main focus to his point of view. This is a very clever way of ensuring compatibility between the author and the reader."

    "section": "The Bad (Fitzhugh, Phillips, and Gjesfjeld (2011))",
    "text": "The Bad (Fitzhugh, Phillips, and Gjesfjeld (2011))\nThis book chapter, which appeared in Information and its Role in Hunter-Gatherer Bands, edited by Robert Whallon, William A. Lovis and Robert K. Hitchcock, is a piece of writing that I think could be written better. The authors develop a model that aims to frame linkages between hunter-gatherer groups within constraints posed by the environment. This topic is appropriate for the publication this text appears in, however there are some structural issues that need to be addressed. There are also some issues with the study itself, and I briefly touch on them.\nAfter introducing the topic, identifying assumptions, and defining key terms, the chapter seems to be divided into two main portions. The first part presents the underlying theory about the potential relations that may exist between hunter-gatherer groups. This is a key part of the text, since it lays out the model the authors propose. This model consists of two variables, (a) the cost of interaction between groups and (b) the predictability of the environment. The matching of high and low values (but nothing in between) for these variables suggests four possible outcomes, and the authors characterize how they would envision interactions between hunter-gatherer groups under each set of circumstances. Although the four sets of variables and their characteristic modes of interaction were described very well in a summary of the model, this was preceded by a thorough yet somewhat confusing discussion on certain types of linkages that we’d expect to observe in various circumstances. The confusion stems from the heavy use of the same word, or variations of that word, multiple times in some sentences (for example, the words ‘predictability’, ‘non-predictability’, ‘high-predictability’, and ‘low-predictability’ are all used very often).\nAdditionally, some of the arguments Fitzhugh, Phillips and Gjesfjeld make are in part based on very general statements regarding the behaviour of modern hunter-gatherers, that seemingly follow a logic of ‘common sense’. However, many of these assertions are not backed up by any ethnographic references. There are also many instances where it may be beneficial to engage with the literature surrounding social anthropological views towards systems thinking, but there was little to no effort to do so. Additionally, I noticed a few instances when the authors made questionable assertions about the properties of network and possible implications for maintaining network coherence (p. 89-90, 95-96).\nThe second part of this text was concerned with a case study that aimed to situate the model discussed above to the Kuril Island Chain, located between Japan and Russia in the North Pacific Ocean. The authors identified source groups of pottery and obsidian artefacts that were found on many of the islands (they did not specify whether the sources of the raw materials were identified as well, although they did note which end of the island chain they originated from), and they attempted to trace the circulation of these artefacts throughout the archipelago. The authors provided details regarding the environmental conditions of the region as well. Thus, values for the two variables of the proposed model were defined, and the authors determined which modes of interaction the island network would support based on the set of circumstances that are evident. Even though only a small portion of the artefacts analyzed were chronologically dated, the goal of the authors was to formulate a predictive framework for understanding hunter-gatherer interaction patterns, and to test whether the Kuril island chain would support such a framework. The authors did accurately predict the kinds of connections that were evident based on their model, and even though the chronology was mixed up, the potential modes of interaction that the geography allowed matched what was evident in the archaeological record. However, this model should be tested using other archipelagoes since the Kuril island chain is rather linear, and the matching of artefacts with material source may have been evident based on geographical proximity rather than conformity to this model."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\nOne of my interests is the utilization of software and hardware to effectively get things done. Beyond formulating my own workflows, I am interested in discovering novel ways that others arrange their digital desktops. After discussing digital workflows in my writing class a couple weeks ago, I started using Sente, a reference management application. I’ve used Zotero before for similar purposes, but I found it difficult to navigate around the interface comfortably and I ended up abandoning it. Sente on the other hand, has a more familiar user interface, conforming to the style of the other apps that I use on a regular basis. However, it is lacking some of the functionality that other refernece management apps have. After looking into other options I found that no software has everything that I’m looking for in one neat package.\nSo I began imagining the ultimate reference management application. I sometimes come up with visions of an app I wish someone would make, but they tend to simply remain as visions. I’ve posted one great idea on this blog back in October, about how I would design an ideal library app. (After bouncing my ideas off friends and colleagues, and discovering that this solution is actually useful, novel, and in demand, I’m hoping to team up with some of the librarians at McMaster to develop it. There is interest in it, but I must wait for administrative shuffles to be made before proceeding.) Writing about it on my blog really helped me develop my ideas, so below is a rough brainstorm of some ways I’d like it to work if faced with no obstacles."

    "text": "Interface\nIndex: The main interface, called the “Index”, is primarily focused on a list of references, containing only essential citation data. Selecting a reference reveals more detailed citation info, any tags a user may have applied, and an embed if applicable. Selecting a reference also shows your history of actions, which includes creation, attaching PDFs, annotations, shares, as well as internal links to highlighted parts and comments within. This is inspired by Astrid’s detailed history for tasks. A central search box would allow users to search and collect citation info from multiple databases (such as Google Scholar, WorldCat, JSTOR), library catalogues, or even open data repositories (like TDAR, Open Context or Pleiades). References may be “archived” when not needed, and pinned to your “inbox” when they relate to your current work. This is inspired by Gmail’s archive function.\nAnnotations: PDFs are opened in another browser tab, where they can be annotated. The annotations tab contains the entire document, along with a tools pane. Tools include: cighlight, comment, quote, free-draw, and screenshot. Various utilities may also be included: calculator, sketch pad, mini Google Maps module, dictionary and thesaurus, Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia. All text-based annotations are in plain text. All text-based annotations are compatible with XML, Markup and LATEX. SoundCloud-like annotations will be used for audio and video content.\nAdding references: Search databases, catalogues and open data repositories via a central, omnibox-like search utility. A browser extension allows users to pull citation information directly from a web page, similarly to Zotero. Alternatively, it may be possible to do this by pasting a URL into the omnibox. Manual input is also supported of course. PDFs and other materials can be attached to references by searching through a public Dropbox folder containing these files. VPN credentials or library login info can be input for easier retrieval of PDFs.\nCollaboration and Sharing: A side pane from the Index would allow connected users to chat with each other. This would be in the style of Google Wave. Chats are conversation based. You can drag references from the Index to the chat in order to share it with the participants. Annotations can also be shared. You can view what others are typing in real time. You can have the option to share specific kinds of annotations\nCompiling bibliographies: Bibliographies are compiled into .html files in “plain text” and opened in a new tab, along with a shortlink. This ensures that anyone can view it, even if they don’t have specialty software to open proprietary file types. This also allows bibliographic information to be copied and pasted to any text editor with ease. Bibliographies can be exported to a variety of file formats as well. Collections of references assigned to a tag can be compiled into an RSS feed.\nWorkflow: Integration with Google Calendar, Google Docs, Dropbox.\nThings to keep in mind: I’ve noticed that books seem to be exceptional in any iteration of reference management applications. There needs to be a better way to handle books.\nThere’s also the issue of sharing copyrighted material stored in a public Dropbox folder. Files can’t legally be shared with others, but there’s no laws against sharing files with yourself. Perhaps the Dropbox folder could act a database itself, and this app could essentially “organize” the files into folders respective of their authors, dates of publication, or other bibliographic information specified by the user. Then, files associated with annotations could be linked with the PDF’s as an “overlay”. The only legal issue would be sharing of PDFs with others, but this sort of things varies across institutions.\nIt doesn’t really seem like I’ll be working on this anytime in the near (or distant?) future. In any case, because this is the ideal reference management app it would be licensed under creative commons and be freely available :)"

Intro: What is the Halaf? What is the Burnt House at Arpachiyah? What are the primary concerns of archaeologists studying these contexts? Introduce the main question: How can a practice-oriented approach be useful for determining the ways by which the Halaf emerged, and for evaluating the distribution of its recognizable material manifestations? What are the assumptions of scholars writing about this? Preference for work at broader (regional and supra-regional) scales. Agency often completely ignored, and replaced with reference to Barth (1969) or similar explanations for cultural contact or change. At other times, the effects of agency are not viewed as transferable to broader scales, and tend to be compartmentalized to intra-site evaluations (examples…). Looking at end products, not process or practice. Lack of phenomenological or embodiment approach (van Dyke vs Chataigner and Barge?). Always reverting to core/periphery model despite constant reminders to consider the role of nomads, to consider actions of individuals first and foremost in the construction of society rather than the other way around.\nWhat are Joyce and Pauketat thinking? How does this relate to space, place and political economy? Through collective action, individuals build society and decide how it is governed. These actions, which effect the larger world around them, are manifested in the archaeological record in terms of practices, rather than end products. Products/consumption may also be considered, but primarily in terms of how they allow one to experience the world through their senses (phenomenology) or through other aspects of their bodies (embodiment). The meanings that people ascribed to places (raw material sources, natural environments, artificial structures, etc) may be deduced through examination of their behaviours and practices, as read through the material culture. These interpretations may supplement or redirect our understanding of socio-economic/political ways of life. If mapping or refining cultural boundaries is indeed the main goal, then this information must be mapped or visualized in an appropriate way — highlighting different kinds of sites, kinds of interactions between them, and processes of raw material procurement or whatnot.\nMove to the data: How do these approaches (Joyce and Pauketat) relate to this specific context? The re-examinations of the material from the burnt house at Arpachiya by Healey and Campbell make further interpretations of the same material easier. Such re-interpretations would incorporate practice-oriented perspectives to some significant classes of material. Obsidian will be the main material considered, but painted pottery may also be interesting to examine. However my experience with work relating to pottery may make this difficult, and I would have to rely on the prior work of others. The burning of the Burnt House will also be crucial to evaluate from an agent-based and practice-oriented approach, but I’m unsure about how to situate this in the paper.\nNetwork analysis: Dataset will include all sites in the “zone of Halaf influence”, including those with only 1 artefact. Might have to look at the sourcing studies for each of these sites to see if finer chronological resolution may be attained. One-mode network of sites connected to sites via similar proportions of raw material (just like thesis work). One-mode with flipped node/edges so that strong similarities are nodes connected by sites represented as edges — used to highlight sites as meeting points or borders à la Crumley and Marquadt 1988. Two-mode network (two “classes” of nodes: sites and obsidian sources), with sites connected to sources (must figure out a weighting mechanism), and its one-mode derivative whereby sources are connected to other sources via sites who use each’s material — this latter networks used to determine groups of sources that are commonly used together. The different ways in which these materials were used can then be added to discussion, and visualized accordingly by colourizing certain edges to highlight what kind of interactions they may represent, or to denote relationships among sites based upon other forms of evidence like pottery variation, use of seal stamps, etc. Final map would look something like those drawn up by Delerue (2007) in her dissertation, but hopefully relating more to inter-relationships between sites, rather than between sites and sources.\n\nComments.\nAndy: Hi Zack, A couple of quick thoughts: Instead of “What are Joyce and Pauketat thinking? How does this relate to space, place and political economy?” I would suggest you consider a questions like, “How might a practice-based approach help with thinking about the emergence of new political and economic systems?” This is because it may push you to read a bit more broadly on what this approach is about — you may want to look, for instance, at a very famous article by Sherry Ortner “theory in anthropology since the sixties” which includes a section on theories of practice. You have lots of data included here. This paper should be no longer than 25 pages… plan accordingly."

Rectangular architecture used in “secondary buildings” according to Campbell (1992). Emerged from the Hassuna, which was distributed across northern Syria and Iraq, more or less at the same time at each locale. This suggests that “the spread of a single cultural tradition over much of the northern portion of the Near East can no longer be dated to a time late in the Halaf, perhaps about 4700 B.C.E.,but must be placed much earlier, at the end of the Hassuna, around 5200 B.C.E.” (Campbell 1992: 183). The Halaf seems to have arose with the aid of already established social “infrastructure” that spanned a wide region, and it’s specific origin point can therefore not be deduced. The Halaf occurs during the mid-point between the beginnings of agriculture and the rise of the first cities, so is a natural place to look for the processes that led from one to the other. Large increase in population from the early Halaf to the late, due to the intensification of agriculture in northern Iraq and Syria. Davidson 1981 and Davidson and McKerrall 1980 have conducted NAA on Halaf pottery and found that it was probably manufactured in only a few locations, and traded elsewhere. Perhaps this ties in with LeBlanc and Watson 1973, who found variations of Halaf motifs correspond with distance. Obsidian is found in large quantities in northern Iraq and Syria despite the long distance to eastern Anatolian sources. Obsidian is found mainly as finished blades, suggesting that it was worked elsewhere and that contacts with these producers was stable and and consistent. No indication from Campbell 1992 regarding the specific sources of these blades. “With a single exception, none of the chipping debris that must have been generated during the manufacture of these blades has been found at a late Halaf site.” (Campbell 1992: 184-185).\nArpachiyah Burnt House - Level TT6 — last Halaf level at Arpachiyah. Extremely rich finds found there. Polychrome pottery perhaps not as common as often believed. Also stone bowls — one of obsidian in the burnt house. Also obsidian links. Also seals and seal impressions. All of this material suggests that Arpachiyah exhibited control over others in the region in a formalized and direct manner. The large amounts of obsidian at Arpachiyah suggest a central role in exchange, and heightened ability to acquire needed resources. Davidson and McKerrall 1980 showed that 30-40% of pottery from Tepe Gawra originated from Arpachiyah using NAA. The Burnt House was probably last of a series of earlier iterations of similar design, suggesting that this control was not short-lived. The eponymous Burnt House is Later Halaf. Despite all this, the small size of Tell Arpachiyah and the variability of Halaf motifs suggest that control was rather limited to a small area. However central position in a trade network, or perhaps a social network, may have bolstered richness despite the small area covered.\nSome larger Halaf sites are hinted but not excavated as of 1992 — Nineveh may have a Halaf layer, and Takyan Hoyuk is 12 hectares (Algaze et al 1991). What will this paper be about? I will draw attention to the distinction of north-eastern Mesopotamia during the Halaf period as shown through my network analysis and through other evaluations conducted by Campbell, Healey, etc. How will my paper distinguish itself? How can this be publishable as original research? I think I will have to orient this paper in a more theoretical light. This suits the motivations of this course. What aspects of the course can I touch upon? Building history up, rather than looking back upon it. How places are used as identifiers of power — the Burnt House as a place of social significance rather than Arpachiyah as deriving power from its spatial location. The resistance of and nullification of power — Week 7: Power, Political Landscapes, and Monumental Spaces (Dahomey as an analogy). Draw attention to the lack of truly phenomenological or sensory approaches.\nIs the story of the Burnt House an event or reflective of longer term activities and behaviours? It seems that Campbell has trouble deciding, since he discusses the physical acts of individual agents as representative of longer-term norms. If burning down the house was not an act of everyday life (is this an acceptable and reasonable “if” to presume?) then how can it be reflective of typical life? It seems to be treated as a threshold, or a reaction to previous actions; as such, trying to figure out the state of living in pre-burning Arpachiyah is impossible by evaluating this non-typical event. I think if emphasis were placed on household or domestic features, a more purposeful evaluation can be made. In Campbell 1992, he starts off with a rather phenomenological approach but then gets bogged down by the luxury and elite goods and the broad-scale regional comparisons. At this point we know of the significance of Arpachiyah, and that there were regional centres. I generally agree with Kristiansen’s view that there was a shift to less decentralized and more hierarchical modes of regional organization, but can we say anything more than that? How does my network for Period 4 address this? There is clearly a distinction of NE Mesopotamia with an influx of new obsidian raw materials, and these are primarily arriving as worked products. I could analyze a new network consisting of sites within the “zone of Halaf influence” — Zagros Mountains to Euphrates and slightly beyond. I could filter the ties differently, at intervals of 5% similarity and graph density, number of modules, etc for each iteration, as well as mini-max (maximum threshold for minimum connectivity of the entire network). Maybe c-finder would be useful for highlighting overlap of influence that may have prompted conflict. Sites with varied assemblages, which do not fit into a particular GN module or have high betweenness centrality, may be considered to have been less dependent on a particular resource provider (consumer wins with increased competition) and may exhibit more market-oriented economic behaviour. On the other hand, those that are tighter-knit within a cluster are more dependent on a particular supplier and are likely engaged in chief-chief relationships whereby a power struggle is always present and decided upon by a few elite individuals who represent the larger group through their dealings with other leaders."

Although it is true that most of these resources are mainly used in research rather than teaching.\nI was especially interested in the section about how classicists find, make use of, cite and collaborate using digital resources. While I was reading this part of the book I realized that many of my professors did not put a lot of emphasis on the digital tools available, and that the classics department, along with other departments that I have studied under, have lacked the incorporation of digital tools in classes.

    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAs I promised here is a report for the Bronze Age wine that I made.\nThe consumption of wine in various ancient settings is a frequent topic of research in a number of disciplines. Much of what is considered fact is based on indirect knowledge, derived from ancient texts, archaeological finds, or studies of linguistic variations. The study of the consumption of food and drink in an archaeological context was inspired by anthropological interpretations of archaeological research, starting in the 1960s and 1970s with the birth of ‘New Archaeology’. This led to concepts that focus on the interaction of the human body with aspects and elements of the world around it, taking both biological and environmental variables into account (Kelley and Hanen 1990). In recent decades there have been increasing numbers of studies of the use of psychoactive drugs that are used as medicinal agents, in religious rituals, and also simply recreationally. A wide range of earlier cultures and societies have used psychotropic drugs in all of these contexts, and these have been explored in serious academic investigations, even though the use of these same agents may not accepted in contemporary society. Indeed there have even been some disturbing instances when these contemporary cultural ideas concerning drug taking actually end up being reflected in the review process of these academic endeavours. Not withstanding these exceptional cases, the ritual use of mid-altering drugs remains a subject of serious students of anthropology, psychology, religious studies and other disciplines.\nAlcoholic beverages can also be included among chemical entities that can have mind-altering effects on people, and have been used in a wide variety of contexts throughout human history, ranging from religious ceremonies to recreational and social functions. In contrast to psychoactive drugs, alcohol is generally an accepted aspect of most Western contemporary societies, so the study of its use in ancient societies is not as controversial. Numerous academic and general-reading books about the histories of fermented and distilled alcoholic products have piqued public and academic interest, and stimulated further investigations that make the history of alcohol more than simply a few footnotes in a social history text.\nI have a tremendous interest in the history of the consumption of mind-altering substances, specifically alcohol-containing beverages, in ancient times. Much of my studies in a variety of courses during my university years have been devoted to this area of research. Virtually all of my academic effort has restricted me to a desk in my home or a chair in the library. One exception was a summer course at Washington University, which runs an archaeological field school at Tel Dor, south of Haifa. While absolutely thrilling and captivating in terms of an ultimate career, I did recognize that though on the dig I was finding real examples of vessels that were used by the ancients, I was still not fully experiencing their actions and facing the challenges that they dealt with to fill those vessels. This flexible final project offered me the fantastic opportunity to work on a hands-on project in order to broaden my perspective, and to try to experience something of what human ancestors did. That is why I have attempted to concoct a re-creation of wine from the Bronze Age Aegean, applying the knowledge that I have accumulated throughout my undergraduate years and additional research I have undertaken. My initial goal was to make a reasonably authentic wine that mimicked the process undertaken by vintners of prehistoric Greece, while taking into consideration the fact that I am limited by monetary and timing constraints.\nAlthough I began this project with great expectations and enthusiasm, I had to face the fact that there were many shortcomings that rendered the process incomplete. Firstly, I started planning for this project in late November, which is long past the harvest time for grapes. This is true for both modern as it was ancient times in the Mediterranean. In order to make my wine as authentic as possible, I should follow the instructions of Hesiod, who wrote his famous poem Works and Days. It is about the daily lives of ordinary people, and he included a form of farmer’s almanac that acted as a guide for agriculturalists. Hesiod lived sometime between 750 and 650 BCE, which was around the same time as Homer. The subject matter that the authors of this period wrote about was of the times of the infamous Greek heroes, whom supposedly were real people living in the Bronze Age. Their achievements may have been exaggerated since these stories were meant to be conveyed orally, and were first written in by Homer and Hesiod in the Archaic Period, following the so called ‘Dark Age’ after the collapse of numerous civilizations at the end of the 2nd millennium BCE. As such, they were subject to modification or enhancement, and their interpretations should be read with this in mind. That is not to say that these epic poems cannot tell us very valuable information about the Bronze Age, and archaeological evidence can verify many aspects of these tales.\nIn this treatise, Hesiod advised farmers about viticulture and wine production. For instance, he says that vines should be pruned and prepared for the ‘rebirth’ of the vine “when Zeus has finished sixty wintry days after the solstice, then the star Arcturus leaves the holy stream of Ocean and first rises brilliant at dusk”. Hesiod also suggests approximate times for harvest, saying when “rose-fingered Dawn meets Arcturus, then cut off all the grape clusters and bring them home”. These astrological events occur on a cyclical basis, and would correspond to the modern Gregorian months of February or March for the former and early September for the latter.\nIf I had had more time to prepare this project, I would of course try to replicate the timing of these crop cycles as accurately as possible. However, due to the agricultural cycle of grapevines, no yearly planting is necessary. Rather, vines lie dormant during the winter and become active again once the environment becomes warmer. This does not mean that no labour is needed; a vintner must rearrange vines according to the orientation towards the sun, check the properties of the soil, and make sure that the vines stay tame and do not encroach on each other.\nInterestingly, the difference between wild grapevines (Vitis sylvestris) and domesticated ones (Vitis vinifera) can be easily recognized based on their physical properties, before even looking at differences based on DNA sequences. Grape pips have been found at numerous archaeological sites, and their morphology can help identify whether or not humans manipulated the growth of vines. Although the changing shape of seeds seems to offer no competitive advantage from an evolutionary standpoint, they do indicate a switch from cross-fertilization to a self-fertilization method of reproduction. Seeds from wild (sylvestris) vines are rounder, possess a nonprominent beak, and show an average seed index of averaging about 0.64 (ranging from 0.54-0.82) (Jackson 2000: 21). In contrast, seeds from domesticated (sativa) vines are more elongated, process a prominent beak and have a seed index averaging about 0.55 (often ranging from 0.44-0.75).” ((Ibid. 21-22.)) The seed index mentioned here indicates their ratio of the length and width. This correlation between seed shape and cultivation is evident by comparing modern domesticated grapes with samples of Vitis sylvestris, and measuring morphological differences between the two. In addition to different seed sizes, other phenotypic features that indicate differences between cultivated and non-cultivated vines include grape colour and the growth of flowers, although these are not evident in the archaeological record (This et al. 2007).\nEvidence for grape growing has been found at numerous archaeological sites, the earliest examples of which appear in the Caucasus region of Georgia and Turkey. Domesticated seeds have been found, dating to around 8000 years ago (This, Lacombe, and Thomas 2006: 511). Additionally, wine residues have been found in jars at Hajji Firuz Tepe, located in the Zagros Mountains in modern Iran (This, Lacombe, and Thomas 2006: 511). By dating the ceramic vessels, we now know that the earliest instance of wine being made was between 7000 and 7400 years ago. A link between the domestication of the grape and wine production is clearly evident, but defining which came first is still being debated.\nEven though the technology existed elsewhere, viticulture was not developed in Greece until the Final Neolithic period, at around the 3rd millennium BC. The earliest wine press in the region was found at Myrtos on the southern coast of Crete, and suggested large-scale production of wine (McGovern 2009: 184-185). This knowledge and technology was likely imparted to the island from the near east, brought by Canaanites or Phoenicians who would benefit by expanding their trade routes deeper into the Mediterranean. In fact, Canaanite wine jars from the Bronze Age have been found scattered around the southern Aegean, and trade routes discerned by modern scholars suggest that Crete was a major stop (Leonard 1996). Cretans may have then passed on the technology of winemaking to the rest of the Aegean to the north, and to mainland Greece as well. Grape pips have been found in jars and large fermenting basins at certain islands in the Aegean (Syros, Amorgos and Naxos) (McGovern 2009: 186), at other palaces on Crete (Phaistos, Palaikastro) (Núñez and Walker 1989: 223), as well as on the mainland (Aghios Kosmas) (mcgovern1009? 186). At these locations, the scripts that were used to describe vineyards, grapes, and other wine-related words, were derived from Egyptian Hieroglyphics, which suggests a chain of culture, at least in regards to wine (mcgovern1009? 186).\nAlthough the exact variety of grape that was first domesticated in Greece is not definitively known, there have been many studies that attempted to pinpoint the genetic diversity of grapes of the Eastern Mediterranean region. It is widely suggested that Muscat was the first cultivated grape in Greece, however this broad category encompasses many sub-varietals (crespan1001? 23). The methods used to come to this conclusion involved tracking recessive genotypes from modern vines, and comparing genetic markers that indicate genetic mutations of the plant. Most of these studies are multi-disciplinary in nature, and include the analysis of ancient texts and material and botanical evidence found at archaeological sites as part of the process of mapping the genetic diversity of grape vines.\nKnowing the general type of grape that was widely used in Greece close to the time of initial domestication, I could attempt to make my reproduction of Bronze Age wine more authentic. I sought out any kind of Muscat grape, which was a big challenge. What I eventually found was a concentrate of Muscat grapes (since it was November I could not find anything fresher), although no specificity was given as to its sub-variety classification. Even so, the exact kind of grape that was cultivated early on in Greece’s history is not known, and so having more specific options would not have made much of a difference.\nAn additional step that should be taken in order to keep the re-creation as close to the original as possible, is to dry the grapes, which helps concentrate their constituent sugars. Hesiod suggested that a farmer should “show them [the grapes] to the sun ten days and ten nights: then cover them over for five, and on the sixth day draw off into vessels the gifts of joyful Dionysus”. The fermentation of dried grapes can potentially produce higher alcohol content since there are more sugars that can be converted into alcohol. However, the main limiting factor of alcohol content in all wines is the capacity of yeast to survive in high-alcohol environments. If low-capacity yeast is used then the wine will be very sweet since the microorganisms will die early on as a result of the alcohol, and the additional sugars will not undergo fermentation. In order to replicate this sweetness I could either follow Hesiod’s suggestions and dry the grapes, or since I used grape concentrate I could add less water to maintain higher sugar concentrations and replicate the same effect.\nIn the case of the wine I have produced, I was forced to use a concentrate, since it is impossible to obtain whole or crushed grapes so late in the year, especially in such a cold climate like Ottawa. Because of the sticky consistency of the solution, I had to add more water, which seemed to be counter to the ancient procedure that Hesiod described. However, another form of sugar could be added to modify the inaccuracy this deviation could produce. Biomolecular analysis of residues inside ancient pottery has confirmed that honey was often added to prehistoric Greek wines, so I decided to use add some in order to maintain the sweet flavour that was intended.\nOther additives have also been found to be have been mixed with wine made in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Bronze Age. Although not much is known about herbs and spices added to wine in Greece specifically, evidence of such modified wine exists in Egypt and the Near East. Because of the lack of information about wine additives in Greece during this time period, I used spices and herbs that have been found at these nearby archaeological sites in this project instead.\nAt the tomb of Scorpion I located at Abydos in Egypt dating back to around 3150 BCE, dozens of wine jars were found containing intact residues that could be characterized. Using chemical analysis techniques, many fruits and herbs have been identified by investigators in these jars, including figs, savory, balm, senna, coriander, germander, mint, sage and thyme (McGovern 2009: 166). Of these, I used thyme and pennyroyal (a type of mint), in addition to the honey that was mentioned above. Not all of these spices were found together in the same ancient containers, and the ratios amongst them that were used are virtually unknown. Because I could not find out about these specific factors, I mixed spices that I assumed would taste good together, based on my own experiences.\nEven though there is not much physical evidence of additives that were used in Greek wine, there have been some finds of residues of kykeon, which is a mixture of wine, barley and herbs. This drink was a penultimate part of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a religious festival centred around the worship of Demeter during the Classical Period in Athens. This beverage also is mentioned in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, which suggests that it was consumed in older times as well. As a part of the Eleusinian Mysteries, kykeon was highly regarded for its psychoactive properties, which stemmed from the addition of ergot, a fungus that may have simulated the perception of spiritual experiences associated with the festival (Wasson, Hofmann, and Ruck 2008). Also, the fact that worshippers would consume kykeon on an empty stomach after a long fast may have enhanced the effects of the hallucinogen (Roberts, Hruby, and Webster 2000: 11-12).\nThe study of kykeon as it pertains to the Classical Period is quite interesting, but it may have little relevance to the nature of the drink and its social implications in prehistoric times. However, I include it here because kykeon is mentioned in Homeric epic, and the makeup of this drink is even described in Homer’s The Iliad:\n\nIn this [the infamous Cup of Nestor] the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat’s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she bade them drink it.\n\nIn this passage there is no mention of any psychoactive ingredients, however this is not necessarily the case regarding the drink referred to in Homer’s other famous tale, The Odyssey:\n\nWhen she [Circe] had got them into her ouse, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes.\n\nAfter Odysseus’ crew drank this mixture they were supposedly turned into pigs, which can be interpreted as either the affects of a hallucination caused by the “wicked poisons”, or simply intense alcoholic inebriation. Also in The Odyssey, kykeon was used in an offering to Hades in order for Odysseus to enter the mystical underworld. The significance of kykeon in The Odyssey suggests a strong tie between this epic tale and the Eleusinian Mysteries, since some of the rituals associated with the Classical festival allude to some of these instances, such as the sacrificing of a piglet and its association with the underworld, which is a very significant theme of the worship of Demeter. Although I will not go into more detail concerning the connections between kykeon as it pertains to Homeric times and to the Classical Period, it is important to note that these ties exist, and that kykeon held religious significance. Because I wanted to recreate a Bronze Age wine that was commonly consumed on a daily basis, the goal of this project was not to make kykeon, although researching this topic did provide insight concerning the use of psychoactive chemicals in ancient times. In either event, I decided that even if I could find them, I would not add psychoactive drugs to our wine. It is enough to simply know about this particular variation on wine amongst the ancients.\nThe study of alcoholic beverages requires some knowledge from other disciplines, including microbiology in order to better understand the process of fermentation. Fermentation is the transformation of carbohydrates (usually in the form of sugars) to alcohol, by the natural processes of yeast or other single-cell organisms. A variety of strains can be used in modern winemaking, and each can contribute unique properties to the finished product. However, the discovery of yeasts only occurred in the 1850s, when Louis Pasteur laid out some of the basic principles of germ theory. Before yeasts could be studied under a microscope and cultured for experimentation, very little thought was placed on the fermentation process; it simply happened.\nIt is likely that the yeast used in winemaking all around the world in ancient times was the strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Dugan 2009: 25). This species inhabits the skins of grapes, and once they are crushed, acts on the juices that contain large amounts of sugars. This yeast is very commonly found in nature, and is even viewed as a teaching model in microbiology and other related disciplines because of its simple structure and behaviour. Because of the likelihood that this strain of yeast was used in the Bronze Age Aegean, I incorporated it into my wine making process.\nAnother aspect of the ancient wine making process is the fermentation vessel. Archaeological excavations at Bronze Age sites around the Aegean have turned up large-scale wine making facilities, as noted above. At these installments giant pithos jars have been found that usually contain grape pips or residues that have lasted the test of time. These are often found underneath the normal floor level, which would help keep the temperature within the vessel regulated while the must ferments during the autumn and winter months after the harvest in September.\nThese large vats were usually non-glazed on the inside, since they are simple utilitarian vessels. Thus, the fabric is very porous and susceptible to leakage. Also, if excess water seeps into the ceramic and freezes, this can causes stress on the material due to the expansion caused by the more organized molecular structure of solids. In order to counteract these problems, pine pitch was used to coat the inside of the vessel and keep liquids from seeping through (Romanus et al. 2009). This would reflect in the final product, and effect how the wine tasted. In fact, later on in Greece’s history, pine resin, which is the derivative of this kind of pitch, was added to wine intentionally to make a specialty wine called Retsina. Greeks still produce Retsina today, and its production represents one of the longest lasting uninterrupted cultural traditions that the world has ever seen.\nBecause of another limiting factor, I could not coat the inside of my fermentation vat with pine pitch. The short amount of time I had to prepare for this project did not allow me to obtain a vessel similar enough to an authentic pithos that could also be used to make a consumable food product. It is very hard to find large utilitarian pottery, as most of the tasks for which pottery would be used in ancient times now employ plastics or alloyed metals. This is especially true for cooking ware, as it is impractical to use inefficient and breakable pottery for various tasks in the kitchen when a cheaper, reusable, and dishwasher friendly alternative is readily available. That is not to say that ceramic kitchenware does not exist, but it is almost always tableware rather than used for food preparation, and is certainly always slipped or glazed in order to maintain health standards. Because of these factors, these kinds of ceramic vessels would not be suitable for this project.\nEven if I were able to find a large enough glazed vessel, the pine pitch would slide off the inside walls, and would not be able to seep within the open pores that a coarse vessel would have. Of course I could just add pine pitch to the must to replicate the flavor, but that also has its own set of complications. Some harmful chemicals are also made from the resin of various trees of the pine family, including turpentine. The ancients may have been ignorant of the fact that certain things that they put in their wine (including lead) were very dangerous to human health, but that does not mean that such dangers can be ignored simply for authenticity’s sake. Obviously I would not endanger the lives of anyone who drinks my wine.\nHowever, one spice that was added to my wine is pennyroyal, which is a variety of mint that has been used for millennia for its medicinal properties. It has been infused into a variety of mediums, including tea and wine. Studies have shown that pennyroyal can induce abortions, and thus should not be consumed by pregnant women (Sullivan et al. 1979). It is now appreciated by the medical community that drinking alcohol during pregnancy can lead to birth defects for the child, and should be avoided all together.\nOnce I had all of the components of our wine selected and mixed, the next decision would normally have been with regards to the duration of fermentation. While I was unable to find a specific source from the ancient Greeks to guide me on this, I can only surmise that fermentation was allowed to proceed without interruption until all of the yeast was spent. I had only two weeks for the entire process, given my goal was to share the finished product by the specific deadline. As a result, I was forced to stop the yeast’s work slightly early and before the process ran its natural course. As a result my wine is quite sweet.\nThe last step of the wine making process is to decant the finished product into smaller bottles. For my wine, I used standard 750 ml bottles that are commonplace today, and are regulated by the strict standards of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. However, the ancient Greeks transported their wine in amphoras, which had a specialized design that helps ease the shipping process. To pour the wine from the pithos into the smaller jars, a pre-made hole that was sealed with wet clay prior to fermentation would be opened and the wine would flow through (Hamilakis 1996: 14). Once the wine was collected, dense clay lids were used to close the narrow amphora necks, which were sealed with wet clay or slip.\nWhen consuming their wine the ancient Greeks did not pour directly from the amphora, but rather decanted it again into a communal serving vessel. Wine was rarely served neat, and was diluted with water in order to maintain a steady yet responsible state of inebriation. Hesiod advises that wine should be diluted with water at a ratio of 3:1 for an ideal mixture.\nAlthough the wine that I have created is not a perfect re-creation of a Bronze Age example, I am still proud of my finished product. What I learned while researching the process that the ancients employed may be very helpful to my later academic work, and provides a first hand experience that I would never have been able to otherwise have while sitting at a desk. I now realize the potential of alternative education styles, and I hope to incorporate experimental archaeology throughout my career.\nThe process of making wine in the Bronze Age Aegean was actually quite similar to modern methods. Essentially all that needs to be done is to plant and then harvest grapes, add any herbs or spices that are desired, let the must ferment, and then bottle and enjoy. It is amazing that such a simple process was repeated by so many cultures across the world, in virtually all stages of known human history. Although our understanding of the natural processes behind the wine making process are much more advanced, and we have learned to optimize the alcohol content, presentation, and aromas that constitute any given wine, the same principles are still there; wine and other forms of alcoholic drinks opens up relations between people, and acts as a social lubricant that plays significant roles in our social structure.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDugan, F.

    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis week I started a project for one of my courses, Themes in Interdisciplinary Inquiry taught by Dr. Marc Tyrrell, that is somewhat related to my honours project. I’m looking into how the inhabitants of the Bronze Age Aegean produced and prepared wine, and I’m trying to reproduce some of the process by making my own. Of course I am limited by time and monetary constraints, but I am still learning a lot by doing research, and my report at the end of this project will consider things that I could not replicate.\nI’m treating this project like an experience, rather than just a typical paper. Instead of doing plain research and spitting out a 20 page assignment, I will complete a report documenting the actual production method that the Minoans and Mycenaeans used, and how it differed from how I am making wine.\nOne of the biggest problems that I encountered while setting this up was trying to find what herbs and spices were added to wine before and after fermentation. There are no recipes documenting ingredients and their proportions recorded by Bronze Age scribes, although in later Classical, Hellenistic and Roman times such records do exist. However, these additives can be identified using chemical methods, and Dr. Patrick McGovern of the Biomolecular Archaeology Laboratory for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the University of Pennsylvania is making broad steps in this interdisciplinary junction.\nIn addition to the help of Dr. McGovern, I also got in touch with Dr. Rod Phillips, a member of the History faculty here at Carleton who is a distinguished wine critic and writes a weekly wine column in the Ottawa Citizen. He also teaches courses about the history of wine and other alcoholic beverages, and is writing a book on the topic as well.\nI find that having an immediate goal as opposed to a long-term accomplishment is very beneficial. Especially if that immediate goal involves a nice bottle of wine waiting for me in a few weeks after the semester is done. I think anyone could appreciate that."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Information systems are used to draw together the work that occurs in various settings, at various times and tempos, by various people, who implement various tools, methods and approaches that produce heterogenous yet complementary sets of information. Specifically, they facilitate systematic recording, organization, storage, retrieval, synthesis and comprehension of distributed sets of information. The selective, strategic or subconscious implementation of or engagement with components of information systems elicit underlying commitments and normative expectations held by the individuals, communities and interests that they serve (Lucas 2012; Huggett 2012, 2017).\nInformation infrastructures are information system designs that carry particular intentions and use cases in mind. It is necessary to imagine how a system will potentially be used prior to constructing it, but its implemented may deviate from these expectations.\nOrganizational structures refer to the commonly accepted and enforceable set of administrative relationships that are established to conduct work in an organized and legitimate manner. May be evaluated in terms of intersections between domains, role and degrees of understanding.\nDomains are assemblages of knowledge, materials, tools or experiences that are associated with the people who wield them. Groups of people who share similar associations may constitute specialist research communities. Belonging to a research community entails adherence to and reproduction of established legitimate practices, language and sensibilities, which emerge out of the circumstantial constraints to produce legitimate knowledge using the particular kinds of knowledge, materials, tools and experiences that distinguish the domain as a distinct field of practice. Association with a domain also entails embodied experiences that are somewhat tangential to the actual practices that characterize the domain. Membership is expressed by adorning symbols, wearing certain styles of clothing, using certain styles of language and means of communication, association with certain domain-specific tools or objects in social or non-work contexts, or participation in shared memory or nostalgia. The expectation to perform membership in these ways has implications regarding the domains’ openness to diversity, since certain expressions used to signify belonging may be strongly associated with broader societal norms pertaining to particular subsets of the population, and those individuals would be able to enact these behaviours more easily or in ways that are deemed more genuine.\nRoles are administrative titles associated with particular sets of duties, responsibilities or privileges. Relationships between roles are typically characterized as power-imbalances.\nDegrees of understanding refer to a person’s relative ability to act in accordance with the tenets of a particular domain. A novice is someone who lacks the intuitive understanding and practical ability to act that experts possess. Expertise accrues through experience as novices carry out tasks, which allows them to consider how operations lead to broader outcomes and have implications for the successful implementation of activities. An expert is someone who intuitively understands the limits and possibilities of one’s approach, who is aware of typical pragmatic constraints that may get in the way, and who is capable of carrying out actions to attain a goal with confidence and methodological rigour.\n\nRelated concepts\nIntuition / intuitive refers to the ability to immediately understand a situation and what needs to be done in order to implement a task. Typically associated with expert or those with intermediate knowledge or experience. Arises from past experiences, especially experience where all stages of the task were completed, and where the value of the task was made clear. Also manifested by or associated with the ability to translate (though not necessarily articulate) between abstract procedures and direct practical experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHuggett, Jeremy. 2012. “Lost in Information?

For Knorr-Cetina, knowledge objects are like well-organized drawers in a filing cabinet. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. For Knorr-Cetina, science is an endeavour focusing on deriving a coherent understanding of the world, which involves the use of already established knowledge objects in the validation of newly arrived at ideas. However, my notion of knowledge differs from this in that it is not necessarily useful in a utilitarian sense. Instead, it refers to the ‘thick’ substrate that new knowledge must be compatible with. It is the context within which archaeological activities are undertaken, which inform and motivate them.\nLegitimate knowledge is grounded and recognized by methodological rigour (i.e. the appropriateness and integrity of methods and data, see below), and therefore differs from Latour and Woolgar’s (1986) characterization of “facts” as detached from the contexts from which they are derived."

The articulation (e.g. jointed, hinged in nature) of mediating objects and activities may be drawn out as long chains, which may be used to infer propositions about connected mediating object and notions that they represent.\nFor example: Soil samples are the mediating objects that flow into the activity of flotation, which produces different sets of mediating objects including botanical samples and heavy residue. Botanical samples may then be processed by an activity that entails identifying and sorting the materials, and carbonized remains might be produced as a derived set of mediating objects. These may be used for the purpose of radiocarbon analysis activities, which produces uncalibrated datasets (another set of mediating objects) that are fed into a calibration program (activity) to produce calibrated dates (yet another set of mediating objects). In this sense, mediating objects are entities that play a practical role in ongoing work. This contrasts with my conception of knowledge, which is more distant, abstract, borderless and fundamental (in the sense that new work has to reckon with existing knowledge)."

    "title": "Archaeology as continuum of practice",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This notion of a continuum or network of practice is characterized by recognition of the diverse array of work enacted through collective effort to contribute to information commons. It accomplishes this by taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of work (Dallas 2015, 440; 2016).[^4] Dallas (2016) is explicit in his promotion of a landscape metaphor whose ecosystems and inhabitants negotiate their differences in a pragmatic manner rather than one that emphasizes control and resource. Moreover, this relates to Cole’s (1996) notion that culture is a permeable and layered substance that nurtures growth and development across uneven social landscapes. These views exemplify a broader trajectory that imagines knowledge work in ecological terms (cf. Star 1995).\nIn writing about specific issues regarding how scholarly content originating from various domains is professionally curated, Dallas brings attention to the ways in which such ecological metaphors might actually be applied. In his view, intellectual and pragmatic inquiry pertaining to the mindsets of the domains of knowledge production is necessary in order to better curate the meanings and intents behind archived material. Curation, for Dallas, is a continual process of interpretation and re-presentation; as objects (either physical or conceptual) are engaged with from various perspectives, they are ascribed new meanings. In other words, each interlocutor who engages with an object passing through their care as part of a curatorial process renews the object’s meaning in ways that both reflect the object’s history and shape its potential down the line. It is thus necessary, according to Dallas, to inquire about the ways in which domain specialists come to know an object and situate it as part of their lives in order to preserve and present the object in ways that adequately reflect its accrued meanings. This requires greater integration of domain specialists as part of curatorial workflows in order to better account for their outlooks as active stakeholders.\nThis outlook is interesting because it more clearly makes use of the notion that objects are sites of negotiation. Dallas (2015) applies these ideas to consider the ways in which the archaeological record is formulated and made meaningful in various ways throughout inherently collaborative, discursive and interdisciplinary archaeological projects. Indeed, his use-case is exemplary since relics, ruins and artefacts out of their original contexts serve as opportunistic lenses through which fragmentary glimpses of alternative realities might be captured. As Huvila (2016) notes, archaeological site reports, which are typically considered to represent the conclusive findings of a project, are produced from a series of complex negotiations among stakeholder specialists, but also present lopsided accounts of the knowledge recovered from the site; the organizational structure of archaeological projects, and the inherent epistemic limitations that guide the logistics and culture of the discipline, shape the final product and influence how it will be used in later secondary research contexts. In this sense, archaeological projects resemble, to some degree, “wicked” problems, whose contradictions, incompleteness and social complexity render them resistant to completely satisfying resolutions (Rittel and Webber 1973). However, further inquiry into the ways in which meanings are ascribed throughout the course of a project, as they accrue via pragmatic and situated experiences, may help to gain a better understanding of the tensions and relationships at play. By highlighting the complex textures of work contributed by various members of a project, those who wish to use the generated knowledge in alternative arenas of practice may gain a better feel for the ways in which it was woven, and thus use it more effectively.\nPaying close attention to the minute and pragmatic aspects of practice, is, according to Latour and Woolgar (1999, 24), what those in the fields of ‘science studies’ do best. By studying the particularities of what scientists actually do, and the ways in which they relate to things through series of coordinated social and technological mechanisms, we may be able to understand flows of knowledge across a continuum of understanding. By observing how professionals communicate and connect with each other and with the phenomena that captivate their interests, we can come to better understand the epistemic culture — the mindsets that drive curiosity and foster growth — which shapes the ways that they understand the world (Knorr Cetina 1999). As a result, scientific research, framed as a wide variety of active and cooperative engagements among people and objects, become situated alongside other ways of knowing. This is particularly important in a world where Mertonian notions of scholarly tribalism between the sciences, social sciences and humanities remain pervasive, despite many years of critique demonstrating that all scholarship actually occurs along an open continuum. In addition to helping foster more genuine cross-disciplinary encounters, recognition of the cultural situatedness of scholarship will enable scholars to more effectively operate in public and contribute towards the potential resolution of wicked problems.\n\nAn emerging perspective that sees archaeology as a continuum or network of practice. Emphasis is placed on situatedness, historicity and social contingency of archaeological work. Archaeological activities are viewed as acts of curation, whereby mediating objects are selected, interpreted, engaged with, transformed and ascribed new meanings in accordance with the particular methodological approaches employed. The mediating objects derived from a set of activities may then be leveraged as viable inputs for other activities, which may produce additional sets of outputs via their own investigative processes. Mediating objects may be accessed by multiple perspectives (by virtue of their externality, portability and indexicality) and their value may vary when incorporated into different sets of activities, according to the warrants, constraints and expectations that each activity entails. The processes involved in ensuring that mediating objects are compatible between perspectives are acts of collaboration, communication and community building.\nNotion of segmentation / articulation?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCole, Michael. 1996. “Putting Culture in the Middle.” In Cultural Psychology: A Once and Future Discipline, 116–45.

ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents. Latour and Woolgar stated that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats. They characterize the latter of these two propositions as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However, from a pragmatic perspective, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production (Latour and Woolgar 1986: 245)."

A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge is thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences."

    "title": "E-CURATORS",
    "section": "Using the model",
    "text": "Using the model\nThe use of the model within E-CURATORS is twofold:\n\nIt is a starting point for defining the QDA code system, i.e. simple regular hierarchy (taxonomy) of terms (codes, in QDA parlance). Typically, the main entity class names (the ones that define will become top-level codes in the hierarchy, and then subclass names as well as types become subcodes). The challenge here is to capture at top level the significant facets from entities in the domain, and to capture also relationships (e.g. with goals and motives) that may be hidden way down in the specialisation hierarchy.\nIt is the reference model to construct a schema for the (graph) database that we want to create using Neo4J, to export and further process the coded-annotated data from MaxQDA. The main consideration for this is twofold:\n\nFirstly, what kind of expressiveness can we expect from the coded qualitative data, i.e. what kinds of relationships between, say, Actors, Activities etc. will be retrievable from the (multiple) codings of segments of data so that we can export them in an Excel spreadsheet and import them to generate automatically graph data within Neo4J? We can use complex code searches for this, e.g. find the (overlapping, identical, contiguous) segments that are coded both with a specific code (and its subcodes) and another code (and its subcodes) and surmise that the two are linked through a relationship in the conceptual model. Some experimentation with a coded paragraph of text, examining the resulting xls output, may be helpful to determine the possibilities. One idea is to define a “container” code, e.g. “Context”, which we can use to highlight/code a continuous longer segment of text that refers to the same activity, or topic, in a participant’s interview, and then seek to just create an output xls with codes from different code facets/hierarchies, e.g. actors (people and collectivities), activities, archaeological entities, tools etc. that belong to each such context, and then recreate separate graphs for each individual context by imputing relationships between entities postulated by our conceptual model.\nSecondly, what kinds of questions/queries we envisage interrogating the database with? These should be derived from our interest in substantive questions within E-CURATORS, on the structure of digitally-mediated / archaeology-related activities people engage with, on the identities motivations, and affiliations of people, on the goals stated for specific things they do, on the use of methods, routines, procedural knowledge etc. in accomplishing specific tasks, on the use and role of particular digital technologies, devices, tools, online infrastructures etc., on the problems and issues encountered by people, and the ways, ideas, approaches, solutions they are considering or employing in their activity, etc. But each dataset (from different E-CURATORS case study) may present us with further yet unanticipated dimensions. What we know already is more or less captured in texts already circulated within our workspace so far, and remains at a general, hopefully shared across cases, level, and a useful approach would be to scan ADS interviews and reverse-engineer a set of queries that are implicit in the material (i.e. questions that this evidence attends to), and, then, subset entities, relationships and properties from the conceptual model into Neo4J property lists/schemas for individual kinds of objects, which will then be used to convert MaxQDA outputs in .xls into graph database structures."

    "text": "The Approach\nLiterary transcription appears to be the best approach for the needs of the E-CURATORS Project. Where it is tempting and more time efficient to go with a standard orthography approach, deviations from standard pronunciation by the speaker would be lost. Literary transcription includes utterances such as “umm”, “ahh”, hesitation markers, and false starts, which may produce meaningful results in the coding process. Further, an eye dialect perhaps provides too much detail, and is critiqued for poor readability, inconsistency and incorrect phonetics. Therefore, prosodic components such as how the words are spoken in terms of the characteristics of pitch, loudness and duration will be ignored. However, paralinguistic component should be considered. These include vocal features occurring during speaking but not as part of the linguistic system, for example include audible breathing, crying, aspiration and laughter. See below for suggested notation on how laughter should be notated."

The first being what they term as “ha-ha laughter” where the approximate number and phonetic laughter syllables are transcribed, i.e. HA HA HA HA. The second being overlaid laughter, which occurs as annotation conventions: so-called ha-ha laughter was transcribed by an approximation to the number and phonetic constitution of laughter syllables; so-called overlaid laughter, overlay on spoken-word syllables. This is difficult to transcribe so it is showed by surrounding those parts of an utterance which were produced laughing with curly brackets.\n\nSubject 1: What do you do?\nSubject 2: HA HA HA HA HA AHH\nSubject 1: I want to know, what do you do?\nSubject 2: {Transcribe music.} Read books. {Swim at the river.

They can not be imported on their own or be automatically assigned to transcripts that already exist within MaxQDA.\nWhen importing a transcript containing timestamps, the timestamps must be formatted in the following way: HH:MM:SS.m, with no spaces between the final digit and the text that the time stamp precedes. For example:\n\n00:00:27.6Zack: Hi, how are you?\n\nA document’s time stamps can be displayed as a table and exported as an Excel file, however this information does not indicate where they belong in the text. It may be possible, however, to align an Excel export of time stamps with an Excel export of a document’s text (arranged by paragraph). This involves lots of manual work, and consistent recording practices at the time of time stamps’s creation.\nMerging MaxQDA projects does not preserve time stamps.

    "text": "Data cleaning\nSome of the keywords remain vague and will generate too many irrelevant results, so we need to devise a methodological approach to weed out irrelevant items in bulk. Costis had suggested that we remove a certain amount from the items with the lowerst PageRank when less than a certain threshold amount of that subset are deemed relevant by a human reviewer. However, this remains somewhat unclear to me and it would be very helpful if Costis could write this out in more detail. Verify that the results are sorted by relevance, and then export them from PoP as BibTex (.bib) files. We will then import them into Zotero as independent collections.\nZotero does not have batch import functionality, so I’m trying to figure out a workaround that would save us time and energy. Here’s what I propose:\n\nUse the Web API to create the collections.\n\n\nSee the docs: https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/write_requests#creating_a_collection\nalso: https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/write_requests#creating_multiple_objects\nAPI access in R: https://github.com/giocomai/zoteroR\n\n\nGo through the collections and import the contents of bib files via the clipboard (control + shift + command + i on a mac)\n\n\nCan’t import the actual bibliographic items using the API, it’s limited to 50 write commands per write request.\n\nWe will use Zotero’s merge function to combine items with matching metadata across all collections. Their association with each collection will be maintained, but there will be only one item spread across them. We will therefore be able to combine the different sets of metadata provided by each database for overlapping items. This will be crucial, since Google Scholar does not include DOIs in their results, but Scopus and Web of Science do.\nAfter this is done, we will export a .bib file for each collection, and pass them into an R script I wrote that uses the DOI to query the CrossRef database, obtain article abstracts when they are available, and export a new .bib file with that metadata included (https://gist.github.com/zackbatist/bfeaa66b64c7afe749a7f5c6f9e596c2). We will then re-import those .bib files to Zotero, and begin weeding out irrelevant items based on their abstracts. We may need to look up the article and obtain the abstract manually if abstracts were not included in the CrossRef database. This final stage of sorting and cleaning the data will generate a list of around 100-120 articles, whose full-text PDFs will be imported to MaxQDA for qualitative coding."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s a weird time to be starting a blog. Twitter has imploded and many of my colleagues have started using mastodon instead. There’s a lot of talk about the virtues of decentralization and of establishing and maintaining firm community values as reflected in content moderation policies and practices. Of course, all of this discourse is happening in microblog format, and is restricted by the usual inability to have any kind of nuanced conversation on the web. I feel that when posting on twitter and on mastodon alike, I’m bound to a formal position, and I find it hard to establish a tone that is my own. This makes it difficult for me to be casual, and to express my thoughts in a way that makes sense to me, especially when my ideas are really half-baked or vaguely critical. So I started this blog to help me retain a more tentative voice that I often express in casual conversations, and which I’m terrified of letting out in more formal or professional spaces.\nThe shift to mastodon has been interesting. It definitely has a very different vibe, but there’s a chance that this might just be due to the novelty of the experience. Sure, there are affordances built in to the platform that enable or encourage certain behaviours, such as content warnings, image descriptions and various means of controlling post visibility, but the value of these features will depend on whether people take action and actually use them.\nI think that the biggest change, whose ramifications we’re just starting to see, has to do with community governance. On twitter, the usual and pretty much only way of responding to inadequate content moderation was to complain and put up with it. But on mastodon there are three main ways you can deal with it:\n\nput up with it,\nswitch to another instance, or\nget involved, give feedback, make change\n\nPeople are very used to the first option, and the latter two require more work. The second option involves a bit of work to find another instance that appeals to you, to create a new introduction post and build out your profile again, and to re-link all your other socials, etc. The third option seems like the most exciting one, since it actually feels like a potential venue for dynamic community building, for personal and collective growth. The distinction between the second and third options may also have lot to do with a weird tension between techno-libertarian and anarcho-syndicalist visions of (web-based) community building (but more on that in another post…).\nThis is the sort of thing that is on my mind as archaeo.social continues to develop. Joe Roe started archaeo.social as a mastodon instance for archaeologists, and I joined him soon after to help with content moderation and to plan some community guidelines (still in progress). I’m learning a lot through this whole experience. I’m learning to be more patient, more open to other perspectives, less controlling, and less apprehensive. it’s still early days, and Joe is encouraging me to sit tight, let the community do its thing, get them to shape the path ahead, which scares the hell out of me. Hours before archaeo.social launched, I even posted a very critical toot about how this would be bound to fail, but look at me now, riding shotgun!\n\n\n\nMe being wrong on the internet, hopefully.\n\n\nIn retrospect, that kind of attitude I posted a couple weeks ago may be what’s holding us back. We need to try things out and play around to find out what else could come from all of this. I’m very eager to have been wrong."

    "title": "AI and extraction from the open scientific commons",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a pretty clear tension between researchers’ obligations to publish their work (ideally, in a widely accessible manner) and the use of these materials to train AI. On one hand, researchers produce knowledge for communal benefit, and on the other hand their work is being used for some pretty egregious purposes. A lot has already been written about this tension, but I’m not really satisfied with any explanations or recommendations I’ve read so far. Chief among my concerns is that an impasse is often contrived by framing it through technical, legal or procedural outlooks which take for granted several assumptions about the status quo. So I’ll jump in with my own take, as a scholar of sicentific practice whose research is about the formation and management of information commons among scientists.\nI don’t see this as a novel disruption imposed by the AI industry, but a continuation of a broader social phenomenon. Specifically, I look at this in terms of shifting social norms with regards to the governance of knowledge commons. When researchers do their work, they produce, rely on, or otherwise participate in information commons. Moreover, their engagement with the commons is scaffolded by technical and administrative systems and by collaborative norms and expectations.\nFor instance, while citing sources, researchers will access prior work made available to them by their library or on the publisher’s website, they identify — based on norms established through their earlier education — when and how to cite sources, and if they fail to comply with these norms they are either corrected by reviewers, criticized for bad behaviour or formally sanctioned by their institutions on charges of plagiarism. Researchers expect to be able to access and cite any prior work produced in their field, and expect to be cited when their contributions are being used by others. Contributing to and extracting from the information commons of scholarly literature is therefore scaffolded by commitments to a collective enterprise, which constitute norms and expectations instilled through participation in a community of practice.\nMoreover, it should be emphasized that commons of all kinds do not have to be, and usually are not, egalitarian. Communities devise norms that determine who can access them and in what ways. As such, the boundaries that effectively limit access are essentially social in nature, but are enforced through technical and legalistic mechanisms. In other words, access to a commons is deemed either acceptable or unacceptable based on the actors’ relationship to the commons, and more specifically whether they commit to the norms that govern access.\nWith regards to AI’s access to academic research outputs, a significant concern is that the commitments and values which govern access are heterogeneous and in flux, especially in light of the evolution of the open science movement. Although this is probably a simplification, I consider there to be two primary camps in open science. One is driven by the design of technical infrastructures and national policy mandates that facilitate and enforce information sharing. This is driven by a transactional vision of information sharing, and considers information as something that can be disembodied, recombined, and easily recontextualized. The other camp is more concerned with reforming science as a more inclusive humanistic enterprise. This means distributing material resources more equitably and removing barriers to participate as a scientist. Whereas the former considers the problems that science faces as technical and legalistic in nature, the latter recognize the root social problems that underlie the mechanisms through which those problems are enforced.1\nThe problem is that open infrastructures and policy mandates, which are largely devised by the technical camp, are incommensurate with how science actually works in practice, and impose new commitments for participating in the commons that are not valued by the communities that actually make these commons possible.2 And to a greater extreme, they undermine the established norms that research communities have developed for themselves.3 Specifically, community norms, which previously served to establish the boundaries that govern who can access the commons and in what ways, have essentially been undermined through claims of universal access, or claims that there should be no boundaries whatsoever.\nBut this claim of removing boundaries is a happy lie we tell ourselves — even the most hardcore open bros expect their work to be cited, and often want their work to be used in a way that is commensurate with their intentions, and not misrepresented. These are very reasonable expectations, and most researchers will adhere to them due to their common upbringing within a community of practice that instilled these norms. But outside actors who are not familiar with this decorum, or who simply refuse to adhere to these rules, are acting out of line, at least in the minds of those who expect or who are trying to foster respectful forms of community engagement.\nDeterminig who counts as an outsider or an insider does matter. However, these distinctions are slippery and shifting. Moreover, they are not really tied to identity, but to the manner in which they engage with the community and its norms and values. It could be helpful to complicate a few common dichotomies in order to explore this further.\nFor example, we might ask about when it is or is not acceptable to enforce or not enforce copyright. Academics share PDFs of their papers all the time even when they have no legal right to do so, and at the same time react intensely when Meta engages in the same practices. However these are not the same things: academic piracy is deemed good when it provides access to underserved community members, and bad when it is purely extractive.4 In other words, the reason why Aaron Shwartz is lionized for his piracy is due to his service to the research community, whereas Meta is an outside and threatening actor in it for themselves and themselves alone. One is a community member who enhances the commons by contributing to it, the other is a notoriously predatory entity that extracts while providing little in return. Another more ambiguous example that lies between these extremes is the Internet Archive, whose work is both informed by professional archival principles while also being driven by a tech-bro attitude regarding how to resolve fundamental questions concerning access to copyrighted work; in developing the National Emergency Library to grant access to reading material during the Covid-19 pandemic, they succumbed to a technical means of resolving an underlying social problem.\nAnother example is a scenario that happens from time to time, when computer scientists or physicists publish high-profile papers in Science or Nature that claim to “solve” archaeological problems using large and integrated datasets that they know nothing about. Any archaeologist who reads these works will intuitively reject them based on the fact that the authors take the data at face value, without understanding the complicated and storied histories of the datasets they rely on, which can only be truly understood through experience working as an archaeologist. And when archaeologists publish similar papers, with care and concern for evaluating the data as potentially mismatched with their intended analytical use-case, and while taking into account ethical and epistemoligical concerns, these works are considered more legitimate and are treated with kinder consideration. The difference is that in the latter scenario, archaeologists are engaging with the data in meaningful ways, and account for the decisions, actions and circumstances of the data’s creation, which they understand through their common upbringing as archaeologists. Computer scientists, on the other hand, view the data as neutral and abtract representations that can be mixed and matched with ease, which is appealing in that field — but any archaeologist knows that this is not true and that pretending that it is produces bad or wrong research outcomes.\nAnother emerging ambiguity it using AI locally and on-device, while respecting privacy, and while using it as a tool to address legitimate research questions — in other words, using AI within the bounds of established professional decorum, values and principles, as determined by a discipline or community of practice. Using AI for the sake of it, or without care for its impact on the work, is unacceptable due to the sense that this behaviour signals a disconnection with disciplinary norms and expectations for the sake of easy hype, which is typically celebrated by AI industry shills and marks you as serving their ends.\nI’m not really sure how to end this post. It’s tempting to apply the label of extraction, but I don’t think I know enough about this emerging framework to make that connection. And I think that, at the same time, extraction is a bit of a misnomer, since it draws an insider/outsider dichotomy that I don’t believe is consistently warranted. We must also acknowledge that we did this, we put our data out there, we linked them, we made them FAIR.\nBut it does seem that the treatment of scholarly commons as materials that can be justifiably exploited in dependent on the notion of universal access. It brings to mind the idea of UNESCO World Heritage sites, which claim exotic built environments for the sake of all humanity, often at the expense of those who are made to live within and around them.5 When we make our data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, we imagine certain outcomes and use-cases, we anticipate who we are making our data FAIR for. But it’s important to recognize that the infrastructures we rely on to share our data have distinct and overlapping goals. We need to ask what open science is for, and who it is for. In other words, we need to consider the scientific commons as a social commons, which include expectations and boundaries."

I relate these observations to issues experienced when sharing data globally on the web using open data platforms. This is part of an effort to reorient data sharing (and other aspects of open science) as a social, collaborative, communicative, and commensal experience.\nMany thanks to my supervisor, Costis Dallas, for being such a great mentor, and to Matt Ratto and Ted Banning for their constant constructive feedback. And special thanks to the external examiners, Jeremy Huggett and Ed Swenson, for critically engaging with my work.\nArchaeological data work as continuous and collaborative practice\nThis dissertation critically examines the sociotechnical structures that archaeologists rely on to coordinate their research and manage their data. I frame data as discursive media that communicate archaeological encounters, which enable archaeologists to form productive collaboration relationships. All archaeological activities involve data work, as archaeologists simultaneously account for the decisions and circumstances that framed the information they rely on to perform their own practices, while anticipating how their information outputs will be used by others in the future. All archaeological activities are therefore loci of practical epistemic convergence, where meanings are negotiated in relation to communally-held objectives.\nThrough observations of and interviews with archaeologists at work, and analysis of the documents they produce, I articulate how data sharing relates distributed work experiences as part of a continuum of practice. I highlight the assumptions and value regimes that underlie the social and technical structures that support productive archaeological work, and draw attention to the inseparable relationship between the management of labour and data. I also relate this discursive view of data sharing to the open data movement, and suggest that it is necessary to develop new collaborative commitments pertaining to data publication and reuse that are more in line with disciplinary norms, expectations, and value regimes."

    "text": "I’m happy to announce that Joe Roe and I just published a paper in Internet Archaeology that explores collaborative practices in archaeological open source software development. This paper has been in development for a while, and we’re glad to finally release our work.\n\nVersion of record: https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.67.13\nPostprint: https://zackbatist.info/openarchaeo-collaboration\nResearch compendium: https://github.com/zackbatist/openarchaeo-collaboration\nZenodo archive: https://zenodo.org/records/12752060\n\nTo briefly summarize: we investigated the under-explored practices involved in research software engineering in archaeology, with an emphasis on collaborative experiences involved in open source software development. We identified not only what kinds of software archaeologists are making, but how archaeologists create these tools as part of a broader community of practice. We conducted exploratory data analysis and network analysis on data from open-archaeo, supplemented with additional data pulled from the GitHub API, to trace how archaeologists use various languages, forges, licenses and supporting features (e.g. issues, stars, pull requests), and to discern trends regarding projects’ longevity, degree of community participation, and overall structure of collaborative ties.\nOpen archaeology, open source? Collaborative practices in an emerging community of archaeological software engineers\nSurveying the first quarter-century of computer applications in archaeology, Scollar (1999) lamented that the field relied almost exclusively on “hand-me-down” tools repurposed from other disciplines. Twenty five years later, this is no longer the case: computational archaeologists often find themselves practicing the dual roles of data analyst and research software engineer (Baxter et al. 2012; Schmidt and Marwick 2020), developing and applying new tools that are tailored specifically to archaeological problems and archaeological methods. Though this trend can be traced to the very earliest days of the field (Cowgill 1967), its most recent manifestation is distinguished by its apparent embrace of practices from free and open source software. Most prominently, since around 2015, there has been a rapid uptake of workflow tools designed for open source development communities, such as the version control system git and associated online source code management platforms (e.g. GitHub, GitLab). These tools facilitate collaboration among developers and users of open source software using patterns that can diverge quite radically from conventional scholarly norms (Tennant et al. 2020).\nIn this paper, we investigate modes of collaboration in this emerging community of practice using ‘open-archaeo’, a curated list of archaeological software, and data on the activity of associated GitHub repositories and users. We conduct an exploratory quantitative analysis to characterize the nature and intensity of these collaborations and map the collaborative networks that emerge from them. We document uneven adoption of open source collaborative practices beyond the basic use of git as a version control system and GitHub to host source code. Most projects do make use of collaborative features and, through shared contributions, we can can trace a collaborative network that includes the majority of archaeologists active on GitHub. However, a majority of repositories have 1–3 contributors, with only a few projects distinguished by an active and diverse developer base. Direct collaboration on code or other repository content—as opposed to the more passive, social media-style interaction that GitHub supports—remains very limited. In other words, there is little evidence that archaeologists’ adoption of open source tools (git and GitHub) has been accompanied by the decentralized, participatory forms of collaboration that characterise other open source communities. On the contrary, our results indicate that research software engineering in archaeology remains largely embedded in conventional professional norms and organizational structures of academia."

    "text": "Last week I travelled to Switzerland to participate in Digital Archaeology Bern (2023). The conference was themed “advancing open research into the next decade” and served as a way to take stock of developments since the 2012 World Archaeology Special Issue on Open Archaeology and Ben Marwick’s influential 2017 paper Computational Reproducibility in Archaeological Research, which came out 10 and 5 years ago, respectively. I think that the conference was a remarkable success, and all 50-60 participants were actively engaged in critical discussions on what it means to do open archaeology. You can find my slides and presentation notes on GitHub (https://github.com/zackbatist/DAB23).\nAlthough there were some elements of this, the conference was not just superficial open-boosting. Most, if not, all participants highlighted challenges and unanticipated implications of being open that they have recently experienced. Looking back, a few themes stood out:\n\nThinking about value proposition that openness entails, which necessarily involves accounting for specific use cases and imagined future stakeholders.\nThinking about the needs and values of all stakeholders involved in doing archaeology, including local and Indigenous communities, land-owners, archivists, government agencies, and related parties, and what openness means for them.\nThinking about how we might reconcile our values as archaeologists with the values demanded and afforded by the infrastructures and communities with whom we must work.\n\nI got to meet so many interesting people. I already knew many of them from social media, virtually-hosted talks, or brief in-person interactions at the CAA back in 2018, and it was really great to put a face to each person’s name. Most serious work in digital archaeology, especially productive work developing open data infrastructures, is being done in Europe, and I was very grateful to have this opportunity to connect with that crowd (especially since I’m currently entering the post-PhD academic job market). I think my paper was well-received and valued, and it opened the door to many interesting discussions during the breaks between sessions and elsewhere.\nI was also able to tack on a couple days at the start to work with Joe Roe on an article we’ve been writing for the better part of 3 years, about collaborative aspects of open source software development among archaeologists. We presented a paper at the 2021 CAA conference on the composition of open-archaeo, the list of open source software and resources made by and for archaeology that I maintain, and we’re trying to expand on it a little bit more with some network analysis type stuff. So this time together really gave us an opportunity to discuss what we really want out of the paper, to actually talk through the results, and generally helped motivate us to get this done. We still have some work cut out for us, but that probably warrants its own blog post.\nAnyway, here are some cool pictures from the trip!\n\n\n\nView of the street from my hostel\n\n\n\n\n\nLithics on display at the Laténium\n\n\n\n\n\nSome stuff I saw when I got lost one morning\n\n\n\n\n\nView of the city from a perch near the university"

This contributes to a sense of “epistemic anxiety,” whereby archaeologists require that data be objective and decisive to support computational analysis but also intuitively understand data to be subjective and situated based on their own experiences as participants in an archaeological community of practice. In this article, I present observations of and elicitations about archaeological practices relating to the constitution and transformation of data in three cases in order to articulate this tension and document how archaeologists cope with it. I found that archaeologists rely on a wide variety of situated representations of archaeological experiences – which are either not recorded at all or occupy entirely separate and unpublished data streams – to make sense of more formal records. This undervalued information is crucial for ensuring that relatively local, bounded, and private collaborative ties may be extended beyond the scope of a project and, therefore, should be given more attention as we continue to develop open data infrastructures."

    "text": "So I think I finally understand LaTeX. Of course there’s still a lot for me to learn, but I think I’m at a point where I am really harnessing its true value.\nI’ve been working with plaintext since I started writing my dissertation. Until very recently my workflow closely resembled an RMarkdown setup, and largely corresponded with this guide written by Ben Marwick. My simple understanding is that Pandoc passes the Markdown through LaTeX to produce a viable PDF, which makes it possible to scatter LaTeX throughout the content and in the YAML front matter. So I had a mish-mash of both Markdown and LaTeX conventions in most of my documents. For instance, I was using the comprehensive graphicx package to render my figures and I was referring to endnotes stored in a separate tex file using the sepfootnotes package, all while using Pandoc’s citeproc bibliographic referencing system. Eventually I came to realize that my workflow was fundamentally built upon LaTeX, or comprises functions that closely correlate with common LaTeX macros.\nI worked using this hybrid Markdown/LaTeX setup for years, until last week when I was prompted by a member of my supervisory committee to compile a unified document so he could better understand the flow of my thesis. I had anticipated that I would need to convert everything to pure LaTeX at some point, and it was as good a time as any.\nPreviously, I had mashed together code from various Stack Overflow posts in order to generate something functional, but it’s a completely different experience when you start from scratch. I started by following the Overleaf guide on how to structure a thesis using LaTeX, and now I have a very robust and elegant setup that compiles a single, tidy, and systematic PDF from multiple sources.

I really struggled to differentiate between the various packages for bibliographic formatting, footnotes, figures and floats and their cross-compatibility. Some packages seem to be developed according to common tendencies, sort of like the R Tidyverse (in the sense of holding a generally common syntax, not in terms of cult behaviour), based around central cores such as biblatex and hyperref.\nI’ve also been using LaTeX to format my CV, and today I started using it to create slides for an upcoming conference presentation. I like how programmatic the CV feels — you script a macro once, call the function along with the text you want it to parse, and you got a pretty little table of all your career accomplishments! I’m still kind of undecided about using beamer for conference slides, but I do like how it encourages me to write concurrently as I create the slides."

    "title": "Some thoughts on data formality",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m using this post to draw out some thoughts that I feel are coherent in my mind but I struggle to communicate in writing. The general topic is the notion of formality, and how it is expressed in data work and data records.\nIn a management sense, formality involves adhering to standard protocol. It involves checking all the boxes, sticking to the book, and ensuring that behaviour conforms to institutional expectations. In this way, bureaucracy is the essence of formality. By extension, formality is a means through which power is expressed, in that it binds interactions to a certain set of acceptable possibilities. In effect, formality renders individual actions in subservience to a broader system of control.\nBut formality is also useful. Formality reduces friction involved in transforming and transmitting information across contexts. Any application that implements a formal standard can access and transmit information according to the standard, which reduces cognitive overhead on the part of actors responsible for processing information. They relocate creative agency upstream, towards managers of data and of labour, who make decisions regarding how other actors (human and non-human actors alike) may interact with the system before they ever occur. This basically manifests itself in workflows, which are essentially disciplined ways of working directed towards targeted outcomes (I wrote about workflows in a 2021 paper and in my dissertation, which draws from Bill Caraher’s contribution to Critical Archaeology in the Digital Age, among other work he’s written on the topic). To be clear, I do not mean to imply that adopting workflows constitutes a negative act. An independent scholar may apply a workflow to help achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently, and empowers them to get the most out of the resources at their disposal. However, one of the key findings from my dissertation is that when applied in collective enterprises, they tend to genericize labour and data for the purpose of extraction and appropriation, which is understood to be an ordinary aspect of archaeological research, as is evident by how actors performing genericized labour internalize this as part of their work role.\nDeveloping a workflow essentially entails adopting and enforcing protocols and formats, which are series of documented norms and expectations that ensure that information may be made interchangeable. Protocols are standards that dictate means of direct communication, and formats are standards that dictate how should be stored. Forms are interfaces through which information is translated from real-world experiences into standardized formats.\nFormal data are information whose variables and values are arranged according to a formally-defined schema. A formal dataset comprises a series of records collated in a consistent manner, motivated by a need, desire or warrant to render them comparable. The formally-defined schema makes this potential for comparison much easier. A common means of representing formal data is through tables, which are comprised of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column a variable that describes a facet of each record. The values recorded for each variable constitute observations or descriptive characterizations pertaining to the object of each record. One can therefore determine what kinds of structured observations were made about a recorded object by finding the values located at the intersection of records and variables (i.e., individual cells in a table). Each record relates to a set of variables applied to the whole set and documented in the schema.\nIn its most extreme, formality entails a realm of total control, where all information is collected and processed according to an all-encompassing model of the world. It is not coincidental that models are the primary outlooks through which both managers and computer systems engage with the world. It has been the dream of bureaucrats and computer scientists alike to develop such systems (see the work of Paul Otlet, Vanevar Bush, and the weirdly techno-libertarian crowd associated with structured note-taking and personal knowledge management). Nor is it a coincidence that formality is a requisite aspect of both bureaucracies and computers. Computational environments and bureaucracies both effectively capture and maintain institutional power dynamics.\nIn some cases, such as with text boxes, the variable may be precisely defined by the values are left open-ended. However, users are still expected to provide certain kinds of information in these fields (I remember at a conference in 2019, Isto Huvila (whose work on archaeological records management is also a great source of inspiration) referred to these as “white boxes”, which conveys their literal appearance and is a clever and ironic play on words referring to the notion of “black boxes” that hide the intricate details of a process behind an opaque connotative entity). In this sense, the standards are thus mediated by social and professional norms, but exist nonetheless. This reflects the fact that social and professional norms, standards, and expectations will never go away, they are fundamental aspects of communication and participation within communities.\nThe million dollar question nowadays (at least in my own mind) is how can we create information infrastructures that strike a balance between the need to transmit information succinctly between computers via the web, and the capability to share context and subtext whose significance originate in the gaps between recorded information and which gain meaning only in relation to the shared experience of communicating agents as members of a social or professional community?"

    "text": "Simplistic description of network graphs\nMy first criticism is about the surface-level description of the network visualizations. Network visualizations are one of many ways of rendering a dataset, and this would have really benefited from more multifaceted statistical analysis of the underlying data. For example, it would have been nice to see the distribution of nodes with different degrees of centrality compared against some other variable, such as gender. The author reverts back to a plain and simple citation count in his analysis of gender disparities, and misses a great opportunity to draw upon centrality measurements as a key indicator of inequitable aspects of professional development across the genders.\nThe author also annotated the graphs with diagrams that look kind of like a compass rose. I only found one instance in the text describing them and their function:\n“In certain maps, the key dimensions that affect the layout of the maps are identified in one of the upper corners of the map.”\n\n\n\nOne of the network visualizations from the original paper. Note the compass rose in the top left corner.\n\n\nWhat do these compass roses actually represent? Are they derived from the author’s interpretations, or are they derived from the dataset? This is unclear. In either case, I would have liked to understand the reasoning or approach for identifying the extremes at each end of the gradients, and how a node’s situation along the scale is determined."

    "text": "Framing of science and non-science\nThis paper perpetuates an outdated dichotomy between science and the arts and humanities. It never really defined either of these things, or attempts to reconcile the terms used by the citations databases against their own notion of what science and arts and humanities means to them. But these terms appear in the compass roses and in their descriptions of the graph visualizations as if their meanings are self-evident.\nAlso very interesting is they say a lot about science but not much about arts and humanities. In fact, it may be more apt to say that this paper describes science and non-science, rather than some alternative other cohesive entity. The author describe journals, topics and methods that they identify as scientific, but do not do this at all for entities that they relate to as belonging to the arts and humanities. The lack of distinction between these terms reveals a lack of willingness to treat the things they represent as things in themselves rather than a lack of something, namely, science.\nThe paper also relies on really outdated visions of the character of various disciplines and of archaeology specifically. As far as I can tell, it relies on two sources:\n\nPantin, C.F.A. 1968 The Relations Between the Sciences, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press\nBecher, T. and Trowler, P.R. 2001 Academic Tribes and Territories, 2nd Edition, Maidenhead: Society for Research into Higher Education/Open University Press.\n\nBecher is extremely outdated and falls within a period when scientists (especially social scientists, including Binford) were aching to make their disciplines seem more scientific. So there is a strange value judgement at play, and they often failed to capture the reality of how science actually works. The other source is mentioned only very briefly in passing, but follows a similar essentialist rhetoric regarding the fundamental nature of specific disciplines, which rubs me the wrong way. A lot of excellent work that examines the pragmatic reality of scientific practice, which highlights contradictions and misrepresentations, and that presents the fluidity across disciplines rather than hard distinctions, is simply ignored (e.g. Latour and Woolgar’s Laboratory Life, Latour’s Pandora’s Hope, Knorr-Cetina’s Epistemic Cultures, Bowker’s Science on the Run, to name just a few)."

Citation networks depict clusters of citations, but the jump to making these clusters meaningful in relation to some broader social or epistemic phenomenon is never really articulated. Moreover, the author indicates they he applied the Girvan-Newman method for identifying clusters, but doesn’t really incorporate the means through which this algorithm operates, including its limitations, into the analysis. Clusters do not simply exist, they are highlighted through some method, which impacts what we see.\nAfter writing an initial draft I found that the author has done other relevant scientometric work with a more targeted scope:\n\nSinclair, A. (2020). From Specialty to Specialist: a citation analysis of Evolutionary Anthropology, Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Work of John Gowlett 1970-2018. In J. Cole, J. McNabb, M. Grove, & R.

The author frames the diverse array of terminology as a problem that needs to be overcome, rather than a very interesting aspect of archaeological research practice with its own benefits and affordances. Standards implemented in harder sciences are stated as goals worth attaining, but I’m left unconvinced that this is really worth doing based on the findings presented here."

    "text": "Today I submitted an abstract to present at the DAB23 colloquium hosted by the Bern Computational and Digital Archaeology lab. The conference is about “advancing open research into the next decade” and my paper is titled Documenting the collaborative commitments that support data sharing within archaeological project collectives. Here is the abstract:\n\nArchaeological research is inherently collaborative, in that it involves many people coming together to examine a material assemblage of mutual interest by implementing a variety of tools and methods in tandem. Independent projects establish organizational structures and information systems to help coordinate labour and pool information derived thereof into a communal data stream, which can then be applied towards the production and publication of analytical findings. Albeit not necessarily egalitarian, and with different expectations set for people assigned different roles, archaeological projects thus constitute a form of commons, whereby participants contribute to and obtain value from a collective endeavour. Adopting open research practices, including sharing data beyond a project’s original scope, involves altering the collaborative commitments that bind work together. This paper, drawn from my doctoral dissertation, examines how archaeologists are presently navigating this juncture between established professional norms and expectations on the one hand, and the potential benefits and limitations afforded by open research on the other.\nI applied an abductive qualitative data analysis approach based on recorded observations, interviews, and documents collected from three cases, including two independent archaeological projects and one regional data sharing consortium with limited scope and targeted research objectives. My analysis documents a few underappreciated aspects of archaeological projects’ sociotechnical arrangements that open data infrastructures should account for more thoroughly:\n\nboundaries, whether they restrict membership within a collective, delimit a project’s scope, or limit the time frame under which a project operates, have practical positive value, and are not just arbitrary impediments;\nsystems designed to direct the flow of information do so via the coordination of labour, and the strategic arrangement of human and object agency, as well as resistances against such managerial control, are rarely accounted for in data documentation; and\ninformation systems and the institutional structures that support them tend to reinforce and reify existing power structures and divisions of labour, including implicit rules that govern ownership and control over research materials and that designate who may benefit from their use.\n\nBy framing data sharing, whether it occurs between close colleagues or as mediated by open data platforms among strangers, as comprising a series of collaborative commitments, my work highlights the broader social contexts within which we develop open archaeological research infrastructures. As we move forward, we should be aware of and account for how the data governance models embedded within open research infrastructures either complement or challenge existing social dynamics."

    "text": "I’ve been working with Joe Roe to analyze open-archaeo to better understand the community of practice around archaeological software development. This prompted us to go back and remove records that are arguably out of scope. We identified a few dozen items that don’t really fit with our objective of assembling software made by archaeologists for archaeological purposes. Many of these are general-purpose tools that happen to be relevant to archaeological use-cases, and whose contributors and primary maintainers are largely, if not entirely, comprised of non-archaeologists (e.g. xraylib, QField). Others deal with specific processes that form parts of methods from other disciplines that archaeologists have come to work with and rely on, such as genetics, ecology and earth science, but which seem too distant from archaeology to warrant inclusion in open-archaeo.\nIt’s a bit jarring to make such a big update — especially one that removes around 15% of the dataset — so soon after we published a data paper about it. However, that paper was meant to communicate the data collection methods, the data structure, and the rationale, purpose and value that underlie open-archaeo and its continued development. We have always been very clear and upfront that this is a live project, but it’s still a bit awkward trying to align our work with more traditional forms of scholarly communication that are suited for more stable outcomes than what continuous and open-source projects afford.\nYou can see the changes in this git commit.

    "title": "Open science and its weird conception of data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In an early draft of one of my dissertation’s background chapters I wrote a ranty section about notions of data held by the open science movement that I find really annoying. I eventually excised this bit of text, and while it isn’t really worth assembling into any publication, I thought it may still be worth sharing here. So here is a lightly adapted version, original circa May 2022.\nThe past decade has seen a major push to develop information infrastructures, or “set[s] of organizational practices, technical infrastructure, and social norms that collectively provide for the smooth operation of scientific work at a distance” (Bowker et al. 2010: 102), that are specifically oriented towards facilitating data sharing and reuse among archaeologists. These efforts frequently identify as participating within the open access (OA) movement, which is a distributed grassroots campaign that encourages greater accessibility of scientific research outputs. The OA movement is in turn inspired by the free and open source software (FOSS) movement, whose goals are to ensure that anyone can run, study, modify and share software without restriction, but which is more popularly identified with collective and non-commercial software development processes guided by the aforementioned principles rather than by a pursuit of profit (Kelty 2008: 254-255; Costa 2013: 449-450). While the OA and FOSS movements are distinct in that OA largely deals with scientific practices and the outcomes of scientific research while FOSS is concerned with software development, they share common concern with inclusive, transparent and collective integration of knowledge and labour. These principles that inform both the OA and FOSS movements are indeed commendable, however the ways that they tend to envisage science and scientific knowledge production warrant critical reflection. Here I identify some concerning issues that have been incorporated into the open data infrastructures that archaeologists have begun to adopt, and which contribute to a problematic and counter-intuitive conception of archaeological data and of archaeological knowledge production in general.\nData are the material records that archaeologists produce to store, transmit and communicate meaning. They are functional in nature, meaning they are tools that archaeologists rely on to extend their understanding of phenomena of interest. In other words, data work alongside analytical methods so that archaeologists can get from one point of understanding to another. Data are produced and used through pragmatic action and necessity, and exhibit characteristics that derive from the circumstances of their creation and their intended purposes. This notion that data are the products of social and material decisions is widely accepted by scholars of scientific practice, but many academics who generate and make use of data in their day-to-day work, including archaeologists, still commonly consider data as disembodied statements about the world as it truly is and which inform more elaborate and complex ways of understanding particular phenomena (Kintigh et al. 2015: 2). This aligns with a popularly held view of science as the collective pursuit of a unified and unambiguous understanding of nature. This general vision of science considers knowledge to accumulate on a grand, global scale, and is thought to inform technological change in a way that reflects arbitrarily defined technological scales of progress. For instance, early hominins’ ability to craft stone tools is thought to have been necessary for the development of iron production, which necessarily informed the invention of steel, and eventually led humans to create electronic computers, and so on into an imagined future that conspicuously resembles the future worlds depicted by a particular cohort of post-war science fiction writers (i.e. Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, H.G. Wells’ World Brain, Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy, Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek, etc).\nInterestingly enough, many non-archaeologist adherents to this ideology rely on outmoded archaeological frameworks that have been discredited for decades, namely grand and deterministic histories of scientific and technological progression. They use their limited understanding of archaeology to identify “technologies out of place”, or artefacts that do not fit in with the just-so technological narratives summarized above. Things like the Antikythera mechanism, the Babylon battery, and the archaeological site of Gobleki Tepe are sources of fervent discussion that often feeds into colonial and racist pseudoarchaeological tropes regarding “lost civilizations” that seeded the remnants of their knowledge to the ancestors of indigenous peoples.\nThe accumulation and assembly of data is thought to contribute to a species-level understanding of the world, which is not held by any one individual but is stored in media such as books, scientific reports, and internet-connected archives (cf. Bush 1945). These documents are perceived of as value-neutral and purely representational in nature, and are thought to be produced and maintained by scholars and librarians exhibiting the virtuous traits of scientific objectivity, openness to alternative perspectives, and the capability to critique ideas in a rational and structured manner (cf. Ettarh 2018).\nThis idealized vision of science is commonly illustrated through the data/information/knowledge/wisdom (DIKW) pyramid, which relates basic and synthetic ways of understanding the world. More specifically, the DIKW model states that representations of a natural truth (data) undergird more complex statements (information) which inform explanations (knowledge) and eventually contribute to intrinsic understanding (wisdom). Despite the implication of movement from one stage to the next, this model fails to account for how these transitions actually occur in practice. Moreover, the flow is assumed to be unidirectional up the pyramid towards a pinnacle of pure human thought. This resembles another popular metaphor in knowledge management, that of the oil pipeline, whereby data are presented as scarce natural resources that are harvested and gradually refined to create more stable and marketable products. Mining for data is characterized as visceral and material work that occurs close to nature, while refining and synthesizing are imagined as more mental and formulaic processes. Like the DIKW scheme, the pipeline model assumes that the starting point is a natural and free-flowing repository of truth, and that researchers must contain and channel it to give it greater value, while giving it artificial shape in the process (Huggett 2020: S8-S9; Dallas 2015: 194). Any sources of friction that impede the flow of data are considered as obstructions that must be cleared or worked around to facilitate the development of more elaborate forms of understanding (Huggett 2022: 284). At the same time, the systems engineered to channel information are meant to protect us, to ensure that we do not get swept away by the “data deluge”, unmoored and lost at sea (cf. Bevan 2015).\nThis drives an obsessive concern with workflows pertaining to legal and logistical issues surrounding scientific publishing that OA advocates deem problematic. Many OA advocates see publishing as the business of typesetting and copyright law, which they could render moot using automated publishing workflows and by encouraging use of open licensing agreements (cf. Foster and Deardorff 2017; Harnad 1998). Viewed as merely technical systems, these could be resolved through technical means. However academic publishing and ownership involve social arrangements that serve to stabilize knowledge, grant authority to validated claims, and enable science to move forward (Kelty 2008: 274-275). In other words, technocentric visions of publication workflows tend to ignore the fact that publication is a cultural phenomenon, whereby projects are made complete and knowledge claims are articulated, credited, and rendered accountable to the people who proposed them.\nThe technocratic system imagined by OA advocates envisions a global web of information, whereby new forms of knowledge emerge through novel integrations (cf. Tennant et al. 2020; Harnad 1998). If bits of data click together and are consistent with a pre-existing understanding of the world (which already clicks together), the new knowledge is deemed legitimate. Science is therefore considered to be self-correcting, since the act of assembling data to produce new knowledge is itself the means through which claims are verified or refuted. This resembles the means of evaluating contributions in open source projects, which emphasizes code’s functionality as a primary factor. If code does not run, there must be a bug, or an inconsistency in the program, that renders it non-functional (Kelty 2008: 220). Contributions to a collective code base are therefore said to be based on merit, or the skillful implementation of code, rather than according to the qualities of the programmer who committed the code (Coleman 2012: 121). This parallels the idealized conception of scientific knowledge production described above, in that contributions to a collective enterprise are considered to be disembodied, unambiguous and lacking positionality ascribed by the people who contributed them.\nThese transformations are genuine attempts to reify the adage that “information wants to be free”, which implies that information is constrained by external domineering forces — namely, the arbitrary restrictions imposed by copyright law and the use of proprietary media formats and communications protocols — and that information can and should exist in a boundless state, which is assumed to be more natural (cf. Harnad 1998). However this bears an unsettling resemblance to libertarian ideology in that each involve a spurious assumption that their key agents of concern are naturally independent and asocial beings, and that these isolated and atomic units may vaguely combine to form products of greater value, i.e. communities or states and knowledge, respectively. Value is ascribed based on market-based solutions (“the marketplace of ideas”), which assume that all actors within the system behave rationally and in accordance with the system’s built-in assumptions (Wellen 2004: 110). In a world where digital communications platforms have come to resemble state institutions to a great extent (cf. Gorwa 2019; Nieborg and Poell 2018), OA promises to enact a populist and anti-establishment vision for the future of scholarly communications, as illustrated by Suber (2003) who remarked that the OA revolution is the start of a new era wherein “scientific communication can be in the hands of scientists, who answer to one another, rather than corporations, who answer to shareholders.”\nAll of this colloquial imagery frames science as largely responsive to nature, and ignores how science constructs data. OA visions of science rarely take into account the double hermeneutic that is characteristic of social science research methods, which considers researchers’ roles in ascribing meaning to the objects that they identify and collect to begin with. And yet, the myth of unidirectional data production and processing persists even in archaeology, despite the discipline’s strong tendency for critical reflection regarding its own practices (Sørensen 2017: 107). This is perhaps due to the practical and bureaucratic contexts within which archaeological research operates, namely the need to produce particular kinds of research outputs that require specific kinds of stable inputs. For instance, since the functional value of archaeological data is associated with their usefulness for generating the kinds of reports that archaeologists deem valuable, which are typically one-way forms of communication that contribute to an additive process of knowledge production (i.e. journal articles, book manuscripts, conference presentations, etc), anything else, including “unofficial” or non-authoritative perspectives and discourse, is commonly deemed extraneous for the purposes of formal analysis, and tend to be dismissed as a lower or less professional form of archaeological engagement, despite wide recognition of their value in theoretical discourse (Hodder 1989: 273-274; Joyce 2002: 138-139). Thus, the information infrastructures and sociopolitical pressures that frame the value regimes of archaeological research together contribute to a particular vision of what data are and how they should be acted upon.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBevan, Andrew. 2015. “The Data Deluge.” Antiquity 89 (348): 1473–84. https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2015.102.\n\n\nBowker, Geoffrey C., Karen Baker, Florence Millerand, and David Ribes. 2010. “Toward Information Infrastructure Studies: Ways of Knowing in a Networked Environment.” In International Handbook of Internet Research, edited by Jeremy Hunsinger, Lisbeth Klastrup, and Matthew Allen, 97–117.

    "title": "Comments on ‘The rise and fall of peer review’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A substack post about peer review is getting a lot of attention, and I’m here to rant about it. Basically the post is calling out the peer review process as a terrible and broken system. And it is. But the author’s rhetoric about it is kind of problematic.\n1. Peer review is not an experiment.\nThe author claims that it is, but contradicts himself straight away:\n\nThe experimental design wasn’t great; there was no randomization and no control group. Nobody was in charge, exactly, and nobody was really taking consistent measurements. And yet it was the most massive experiment ever run, and it included every scientist on Earth.\n\nThese are not just things that make an experiment bad, they are things that preclude peer review from being an experiment altogether. Experiments are run on samples, they are run with intent, they are performed in controlled environments. As someone who calls himself an experimental psychologist and who calls his blog “experimental history”, he really extends the term experiment in weird ways. This use of the term is like referring to the “experiment of democracy”, basically just grand rhetoric for “we’re figuring things out and learning as we go”.\nThe author also seems to think of the experiment of peer review as a pass/fail test, which again, is not what experiments are for. He sets bars for what successful scientific evaluation ought to look like, and measures his experiences of peer review against it. But this is not an experiment, this is qualitative assessment. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s troubling how the author wraps his proclamation that peer review is bad and should be abolished within some phony hearkening to science-core.\n2. General discourse is not enough to validate truth statements.\nVarious parts of the post indicate that the author considers science to be the evaluation of statements of truth, which can only be verified by their fidelity to observed reality. Ok, fair enough. But he refers to Einstein’s large body of non-reviewed work as an argument for relying on discourse among educated fellows as an efficient way of evaluating the quality of scientific work. Despite Einstein’s apparent genius, which is cemented in popular imagination but who also happened to be wrong about some things, this is not reason enough to abolish peer review. Moreover, the author does not consider the general acceptance of non-reviewed ideas that happened to be wrong as a counter point that clearly refutes his main point.\n3. What about non-experimental methods?\nThe author has a huge blind spot for non-experimental methods. He suggests that if the results of a scientific analysis can be replicated, then that is good enough for acceptance into an authoritative cannon of truth. Moreover, he indicates that work that can not replicate is “a whole lotta money for nothing”, basically a waste of time and resources. But a lot of science can not be replicated, by virtue of the fact that science doesn’t always follow experimental protocols that allow for replication tests to be performed. Fantastic and valuable work that relies on non-experimental heuristics, including a lot of work in the social sciences and humanities, climate science, ecology, astronomy and various other fields, are left in the lurch. His take on non-replicability in these disciplines reads a lot like the unethical and ironically non-replicable Sokal hoaxes that serve as the basis for unhinged right-wing attacks on the social sciences and humanities.\nThis also contradicts the author’s hearkening to discourse among learned men of olde as a way of dealing with problems relating to peer review. Opening up the comments section, even if just limited to a curated list of credentialed scholars, is not the same as conducting independent replication studies. I think the reasoning behind this link is that if other people have experienced similar phenomena in their own labs, then it’s more likely to be accepted as true. But this is not the same as replication under the same conditions, it is just the same uncontrolled consensus-based evaluation criteria as peer review but with an open filter.\n4. Peer-review in context\nI agree with many of the things that the author is saying. Yes, there are many ways in which peer review is broken and could be improved. For instance, I agree with the notion that peer reviewers do not dive deep enough into the data and aren’t always critical enough. But I think that this is because most people are unprepared to do so, either because they do not have access to data or do not know how to work with statistics or read code. Moreover, certain journals like PNAS give preferential treatment to certain authors over others, and there are definitely major issues with racism and sexism in the evaluation process. Open peer review does not resolve these issues, namely because it treats peer review in isolation.\nThe only way to make peer review better is by instilling good scholarly practices in the next generation of scholars. However, this is inhibited by structural issues, such as the tight job market that favours quantity of peer reviewed articles over any other factor, and the general prestige economy of academia. These are the root issues. The foul state of peer review is one aspect of this mess, alongside structural racism, sexism and transphobia, the sheer expense of obtaining an advanced degree and excelling in the years immediately post-PhD, and the pressures to conform trends that get you funding. You can not separate the problems with peer review from these issues. Yet somehow the author manages to completely side step these concerns, identifying the broken peer review system as a purely epistemic problem, rather than a problem with tangible and far-reaching social implications."

    "text": "This week I participated in ArcheoFOSS in Turin, Italy. I’ve always been keen to present at this conference but somehow never really felt I had much important to say (aside from open-archaeo stuff, but Joe Roe and I already presented about it at the 2021 CAA conference, and more detailed analysis is still in the works). But this year Joe and I took the opportunity to co-lead a panel on archaeology and the fediverse based on our experiences administrating and moderating the archaeo-social mastodon instance. Our panel was meant to highlight key challenges and opportunities for collectively-owned and community-led scholarly social media, and while it only consisted of a few papers, it definitely got the ball rolling on further critical discussion regarding the role of the fediverse and decentralized communication protocols in online archaeological discourse. Joe and I are initiating work on a position paper that assembles the main ideas presented during the panel and subsequent discussion, so stay tuned for more on that. In the meantime, you can access our introductory remarks on zenodo and github.\nI also presented a paper on the challenges I experienced integrating and reusing data during my Master’s thesis, which I completed 8 years ago, basically summarizing its failures (trying to channel Shawn Graham’s Failing Gloriously). This basically served as a venue for finally presenting my long-held yet unpublished uncertainties about the value of analyses that integrate legacy data, drawn from my personal experiences.\nI really appreciated how low-key and relaxing the conference was. It was great to just have a casual experience with a relatively small group of like-minded researchers. I was very fortunate to be able to travel to Turin and participate in person. I also went on a nice post-conference excursion to Genoa, which is a truly lovely city.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I do not consider agency to be a measurable or rankable quality. For me, agency is a relational quality. It is about how people fit into particular roles, as part of specific situations. One’s agency is never fixed, and their ability to act in particular ways is called for depending on the situation at hand and the limitations that need to be overcome.\n\nKinds of agency\nThese are all roles, attitudes or activities that switch or overlap depending on context, or on the activity of focus. This is more about recognizing roles and how they shift in different inter-related contexts.\nAn originator creates original entities. Founding directors are the originators of projects. While projects may be prompted by earlier work and lingering questions or concerns, the act of establishing a project is a significant milestone. The act of creating a trench in the context of the overall site situates the field director as the originator. The act of creating a trench in the context of the progression of work and the recording of its contents situates the trench supervisor as the originator.\nA schematizer identifies, distinguishes, relates and prioritizes attention towards particular entities or kinds of entities. Schematizers set rules regarding how things should be done, framing subsequent work done by others. Writing the excavation manual, giving an instructional demonstration of how to characterize sediments, introducing staff and their roles at the start of a project are all examples of schematizing.\nA formalizer fits ‘fuzzy’ notions into concrete, discrete and orderly structures. They may also implement stricter and enforceable rules within recording systems. Translates between imprecise archaeological practices and the formal demands of the broader scientific enterprise. Thinking ahead, and in terms of the ‘big-picture’, the progression of work in the long term.\nA motivator rallies people and creates an environment where people are not only excited to perform their tasks, but to do them properly and as stipulated by established guidelines. This can be specific people on site who act as role models, visiting experts who prompt greater rigour, or local liaisons who garner support to accept foreigners into their communities.\nAn automaton is someone who responds to direction given by others. Automatons are typically novices, but may graduate to become 1st level intermediaries if they are able to abstract their experiences out from directly local circumstances as knowledge, and incorporate these experiences and knowledge into future work.\nA consultant is someone who works in their own manner and has wide leeway to work independently, but is ultimately motivated to contribute to the projects communal aims. Specialists are typically consultants, except when their work is integral to the project and relate to core schematization that inform further work. Consultants’ work tends to be offshoots of the core project and the results of their inquiry are often used as supportive evidence rather than as direct/original/root claims; however, they may prompt further core work to be done, but this may be more a matter of good timing than standard procedure."

I may write this up into a paper one day.\nForm: a (pre-)defined shape or structure, the verb is a bit more ambiguous but this is appropriate because forks as nouns are not created, they already exist.\nTherefore the noun to form is akin to a nominalization, which may be counter-intuitibe because a nominal form is turning a verb into a noun.

    "text": "Activity systems are systematic articulations of various aspects of practice, which are helpful for documenting how procedures, or normative plans of action, are enacted. Activities are comprised of a series of actions, which contribute towards, but do not completely satisfy on their own, the activity’s objectives. Actions are therefore considered to be intermediate processes that work in tandem to achieve greater ends (Leont’ev 1974: 23). Actions are executed in response to specific tasks, which are goals that are constrained by specific conditions. In order to realize these goals, actors conduct operations, which are dictated by these practical conditions (Leont’ev 1974: 25-26). Successful operations that lead to the completion of a task bring about new conditions that call for new tasks to address following their own sets of actions and operations. Such chains of tasks warranting further actions and operations are referred to as procuedures or routines (Leont’ev 1974: 26-27). In order to achieve an activity’s objectives, it is necessary to mobilize a series of tools. Tools are the physical or conceptual entities that are harnessed in the operationalization of tasks. Tools enable operations to go forward by allowing actors to overcome the conditions that separate actors’ current states from their desired goals (Leont’ev 1974: 27-28).\nIt’s also important to distinguish between tools and mediating objects. In my mind, tools are like independent variables, whose effects, when applied in certain ways, are predictable, consistent and well understood; this motivates their selection as helpful entities. On the other hand, mediating objects are like dependent variables, interchangeable entities that ‘flow through’ an activity, that are acted upon and elicit varied responses, which are then slotted into or normalized against controlled schemas or formats when rendered as an activity’s outputs.\nI draw from the vocabulary of activity theory as a handy way to break down and articulate various aspects of practice, particularly to document how procedures, or normative plans of action, are actually enacted. I think that the emphasis on goal-setting and goal-attainment may be very useful for examining the situatedness of practice, particularly with regards to the different goals that people set, the different roles that common tools and mediating objects may have, and the potential for activities and the goals that drive them to be interdependent, nested or otherwise conducted in parallel, complementary or mutualistic ways. As such, I am not interested in documenting activity systems for the sake of articulating a map of interconnected components and relations (cf. Engeström 2000). Instead, I will use the framework provided as a means eliciting the characteristics of collaborative intersections.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEngeström, Y. 2000. “Activity Theory as a Framework for Analyzing and Redesigning Work.” Ergonomics 43 (7): 960–74. https://doi.org/10.1080/001401300409143.\n\n\nLeont’ev, A.

You have a set of materials, a set of circumstances, and a hunch about what kinds of methods or activities might be amenable to obtaining a viable or useful result or output. Archaeological projects rely on people who have navigated or wayfared their way in a direction that is useful to the projects’ purposes. Archaeology does not ‘borrow’ from other disciplines. In fact, it is a locus where wayfaring individuals may get together and assemble their experiences to address questions of archaeological concern. A key difference between archaeologists who specialize in X and X-ologists who dabble in archaeology is the ability to consider constraints or limitations imposed by the fragmentary input materials, the alignment to broader goals and understandings of what kinds of knowledge are capable to achieve. Archaeologists are ‘realistic’, they know when something may be genuinely useful and how to call bullshit, but this requires or is founded upon a presumption of a common sense of purpose or communal understanding of goals."

Self-awareness is particularly important in recognizing and correcting with archaeology’s colonial origins and continuing tendencies. There is also a tendency for archaeologists to theorize about the discipline in non-robust ways. For instance, some archaeologists have recently been obsessed with Latour’s actor-network theory to document socio-technical systems and interactions, without necessarily reflecting upon the limits of the approach (Collins and Yearley 1992) or anything that critically extends Latour’s original work (i.e. Knorr-Cetina’s Epistemic Cultures, a lost of work coming out of feminist posthumanism). I think that a lot of uncertainty has arisen from the ‘post-theoretical’ period that we are thought to inhabit (if we are to follow the chronological model of archaeological theory), which I would prefer to call pragmatism as driven by neoliberalism. Thinking about systems and interoperability of agents/actants may help reify and legitimate the actants even when they are rarely well-defined or justified, and explanations regarding their variable motivations and outlooks pertaining to their assumed interactions are rarely explored in depth.\nSome common tropes include:\n\ninfrastructures as information pipelines, helping transform ‘raw’ data into refined and value-added products\nthe data-information-knowledge-wisdom pyramid\nuse of munsell charts as representations of trained perspectives"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Previous work examining the apparatus of science relies heavily on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) or similar approaches that highlight the agency and impacts of tools on research practice. These draw attention to how non-human objects not only frame how human beings inhabit the world, but “push back” upon human actions with significant effects (Latour 1992). In the context of early studies of scientific research, ANT was used to understand the physical and communicative mechanisms — made up of non-human agents and information objects — upon which scientists rely to capture, document and ascribe meaning to particular facets of the world (cf. Latour and Woolgar 1986). ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents.\nFor instance, (Latour and Woolgar 1986) initially applied ANT to investigate how knowledge is produced by molecular biologists in a laboratory setting. In this work, they identified the processes of transcription and translation as mechanisms through which material engagements between non-human objects (i.e. objects of nature) are rendered in ways that may be understood by humans. For instance, in a biomolecular lab, a bioassay determines and represents the existence and qualities of discrete proteins that have been extracted from cell samples through reactions with specially selected reagents, marked with dyes selected for their non-reactive qualities, and pulled through a filtration medium that separates proteins according to their mass, molecular structure, and electromagnetic properties. A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge was thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences.\nSuch a comprehensive view of the system of interacting agents, however, betrays the pragmatic and situated nature of the process. Indeed, Latour and Woolgar (1986, 245) concluded that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats, and they characterize latter as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However through a pragmatic lens, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production.\nRealizing this, Knorr Cetina (2001) highlighted how every action taken in the production of knowledge is underpinned by a desire to fill a gap in knowledge. Integral to this approach is her definition of knowledge objects, which are defined as settled statements about the world, which tend to be the goal of most scientific pursuits. Knorr-Cetina illustrates this as drawers in a filing cabinet, which have been organized squarely and that are accessible for retrieval. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. Knowledge objects are comparable to Latour and Woolgar’s (1986, 76) definition of facts as timeless and author-less accounts of reality, which have been elevated from the material systems that would otherwise constrain them as contingent to the specific material setup of the lab. However, Knorr-Cetina’s concept renders knowledge production as a more dynamic, constructive and situated process that involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly arrived at ideas (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181–82).\nHer approach adds pragmatic and discursive elements, which help frame scholarly practices from the perspectives of the practitioners themselves, in terms of potentiality, certainty and desire. For instance, the desire of a lab technician to have the protein react as she expects it to will guide her practices, including her selection of reagents used to interact with it (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181). She thus alters the material assemblage of the system based upon her contextualization of what has or has not worked before, her educated hypothetical suppositions concerning the ways various actors might interact, and a reiteration of her goal. Her concern with the elusive nature of the protein thereby derives from her consideration of how the knowledge she might obtain will fit into the established order.\nKnorr Cetina’s work reveals how ANT does not adequately account for the circumstances through which the structures that support science come into being, nor the intentionality of human agents who assemble material apparatus to meet their goals. She refocuses attention on discursive aspects of knowledge production by considering expressions of potentiality, certainty and desire elicited by scientists as subjects acting with intent. This emphasis on the role of the subject, who conceives of other things from a unique perspective, introduces some asymmetry with respect to the roles of actors in the overall system. However, it does not totally dismiss the agency of non-human actors; it merely recognizes that the agency of objects are harnessed by humans and strategically configured into productive systems.\nIn other words, this approach recognizes that a scientific observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from modern cultural processes, and who selects signal from noise. It also enables science to be viewed as a collaborative and discursive process, comprising a convergence of methodologies and theoretical outlooks, often upon the same materials. This prompts recognition that ‘the scientific record’ exists in multiple forms, and varies according to the diverse range of perspectives that may characterize the objects of enquiry in different ways. When presenting their findings, scientists thus engage in discursive processes of semantic negotiation, comparing our own conceptions to those held by others.\nScientific data may therefore be considered as a connective medium that enables research to be conducted in a continuous and collaborative manner.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKnorr Cetina, Karin. 2001. “Objectual Practice.” In The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory, edited by Theodore R.

    "text": "Curation encompasses a theoretical perspective, developed by Dallas (2007, 2015), that I adopt as a way to consider how mediating objects are continuously selected, interpreted, engaged with, transformed and ascribed new meanings through series of situated and pragmatic activities. Mediating objects’ capacity to mediate between multiple perspectives (by virtue of their externality, portability and indexicality) is prioritized over their roles as documentary or evidential record. Mediating objects are considered as sites of negotiation, whose value may vary when incorporated into different sets of activities, according to the warrants, constraints and expectations that each activity entails.\nArchaeology is considered as a continuum or network of practice, as opposed to a linear progression or research cycle. This entails taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of archaeological work (Peircian notion of the index, his preference for upholding knowledge through multiple cables rather than a singular chain (and adoption by Wylie (1989)), pragmatic maxim implies the possibility of alternative approaches, i.e. a continuum of possible engagements).\n\nPeirce approaches the problem of verification from the perspective of is pragmatic maxim. He shifts the burden of testing away from the outcome of a single study conducted by one scientist to the outcome of multiple studies conducted by the scientific community. Truth is thus not an absolute, but rather a never-ending social inquiry and its status is rendered by the scientific community not at any particular moment in time, but in the long-run (Preucel 2006: 254).\n\nDraws from the notion of digital curation (Yakel 2007).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDallas, Costis. 2007. “An Agency-Oriented Approach to Digital Curation Theory and Practice.” In ICHIM07 - International Cultural Heritage Informatics Meeting, Proceedings 2007, 1p.

The physical record of material occupies the empirical domain when materials are found, excavated, individualized and selected, and then subsequently represented, transformed and interpreted to construct a textual record. The archaeological record as a documentary archive, which comprises the traces and inscriptions of archaeological facts made in the light of the prior knowledge, middle range theories, intuitions, and sense experiences of archaeologists as they conduct their research, is constructed at the same time as its material form is irrevocably destroyed through excavation, gradually taking its place as evidence. These physical and informational aspects of the archaeological record each formulate the other. The informational archaeological record is recognized as a product of the physical collection and analysis of materials, and the physical record is formulated and delimited through the conception of materials by the minds of archaeologists. This way of thinking about the formulation of the archaeological record puts activity at centre stage. An archaeological observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from cultural processes, who differentiates signs of modern intervention from activities performed by the archaeological other, and who selects signal from noise.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDallas, Costis. 2015. “Curating Archaeological Knowledge in the Digital Continuum: From Practice to Infrastructure.” Open Archaeology 1 (1): 176–207. https://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2015-0011."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile discussing Tim Ingold’s work in class today, and going over the ways that he conveys his ideas, I began to think about how we construct and communicate an understanding of the world around us as social scientists. The use of analogy is really interesting because comparative examples get points across very effectively. Also, there is a tendency for social theories to be commonly structured in terms of dialectical relationships or dualities, which suggest an opposition between two forces, a common structure in myth-making. I’m left wondering whether similar comparisons between social theory and mythology can be made.\nIncidentally, I recently re-watched one of my favourite episodes of Star Trek for the gazillionth time, Darmok. In this episode, the Enterprise encounters representatives of the Children of Tama, or the Tamarians, a society that has puzzled the federation for generations due to their seemingly incomprehensible language. Their language primarily consists of many proper nouns and grand actions, however without understanding the meaning behind these names and the situations behind the actions mentioned, it is impossible to fully comprehend what is being communicated. As is implied throughout the episode, these recurrent words refer to scenes from mythology, and the Tamarians communicate via analogy to these commonly understood ideas.\nIt was only through re-creation of elements in these stories that Picard was able to understand anything that Dathon, the Tamarian captain, was trying to communicate. They beam down to an isolated planet, where Dathon hands Picard a knife. Picard totally misunderstood this gesture as an invitation to duel, but later on he opened his mind a bit when he began to notice various other gestures contradicting this assumption. Moreover, Picard realizes that there is hope to understand the language, and that understanding it may in fact lead to positive outcomes. When Picard realized that they were in danger, that there was a problem that could be resolved through Dathon’s proposed gesture, he was totally willing to play along in order to overcome the conflict. Dathon was critically wounded in the fight, and as he lay dying, Picard had his amazing a-ha! moment when everything seemed to click, in a similar way as when a puzzling concept gets untangled in my own mind. Finally, through his retelling of the Epic of Gilgamesh to Dathon, Picard develops a more complete understanding of how to communicate with him and the rest of the Tamarian people. Through this, Picard realizes that his own life, and his already established way of doing things, were already influenced by the same ideas that make up the Tamarian language."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe articles that I read this week dealt with the impact of the physical landscape on human behaviour and associated material manifestations. I started by reading Ingold’s (1996) book chapter, which was primarily concerned with the dissolution of the oft-conceived nature/culture divide. Ingold attempted to portray humans as entities embedded within the same fabric as what is often termed “natural” or “environmental”. In particular, he focuses his attention towards contemporary views of hunter-gatherer groups. Ingold offers alternative views of the roles of three hunter-gatherer groups, by viewing the management of nature less as economic or subsistence oriented behaviour but rather through the lens of social or spiritual perspectives. Instead of understanding hunting and gathering as behaviour guided by principles of optimization/maximization/minimization, which tend to distinguish humans as consumers of nature and hence as distinct from the natural world, Ingold suggests that the utilization of certain natural resources is embedded within social worldviews that are not as strongly oriented towards this aspect of human exceptionalism.\nAlthough Ingold did not explicitly recognize the agency of the environment and non-human organisms (he did acknowledge that they do possess agency, but rather broadly), these ideas were picked up by Bauer (2014) and Bradley (2000). Bauer showed how the landscape could explicitly shape human activities and alter the social fabric of humans. More specifically, he notes that certain geological formations allowed for individuals at particular locations to construct monuments alongside quarries that were already being mined, whereas this was not possible in other areas. In this way, it is understood that geological processes effect how places imbued with special meaning were constructed. Similarly, Bradley looked at the places where metal artefacts were found in sacrificial contexts, in order to reconstruct the worldviews of those who engaged in relationships with naturalistic deities.\nThe work of Bauer and Bradley gave me more things to think about. Bauer was very concerned with the ascription of agency to the landscape, and this prompted me to reassess what is capable of possessing agency, and whether the definition of agency should be expanded. He sites Latour (2005:71), whose broad definition of an agent encompasses “any thing that does modify a state of affairs by making a difference”. I was a bit reserved to accept this definition since, from a perspective that emphasizes complexity theory, non-linear causation and chaos theory, virtually anything could possess agency. This ultimately devalues the term. Moreover, it is difficult for me to wrap my head around the ascription of agency to broad-scale entities such as geological formations. I am more prone to accept as agents things that humans interact with on a day-to-day basis on a comparable scale, such as buildings and moveable objects; however geological “things” exist/occur at vastly different orders of magnitude. It is true that we enact culture in a particular environment that influences our behaviours to some degree, but when all is said and done it is the current state of the environment as sensed through our senses (which changes from moment to moment) that effects how I will act. In other words, the fact that the earth formed throughout billions of years does not impact my actions, however the current environment, which exists as a result of previous natural activity, does.\nBradley’s work seems to be more agreeable in this sense, since what he terms “natural places” are actually ascribed agency by the people who attend to them. They are noticeable contemporary features of the landscape, and are consistently part of contemporary consideration. Bauer’s work reminded me of discussions concerning the development of agriculture in the Levant as a potential response to the Younger Dryas climatic fluctuation, which has been criticized by many (but certainly not by everyone) for its environmental deterministic tendencies. It is also reminiscent of discussions concerning global warming and climate change today, which is nearly imperceivable due to the long term effects of the associated phenomena. In a way, one key strategy of environmental movements is getting people to recognize the effects that global warming has or will have on peoples’ day-to-day lives; or in other words, to get people to recognize the agency of “mother earth”."

I will be explaining how I used network analysis in my project, and also on how this methodology can be used in archaeology or other academic disciplines of the social sciences.

There is so much green space, the buildings have charm, and I’ve spotted some wildlife here and there. This is a good setting for a new phase in my life to unfold. However, there are some issues at home. Typical roommate annoyances, lack of an internet connection (which will only be DSL when it finally gets connected), and tons of spiders in my new attic room. I guess this will encourage me to get to campus more often and focus on work rather than deal with those issues at home."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been doing lots of reading in preparation for my Space, Place and Landscape Paper while on vacation. One book in particular really had a large impact, Timothy Pauketat’s Chiefdoms and Other Archaeological Delusions (2007). It is a fantastic synthesis of historical processualism that doesn’t get too bogged down with citation chains or jargon, and was extremely relatable. It definitely got me to think about practice theory in a more practical way. I followed up by re-reading many key articles concerning the emergence of the Halaf and how it is defined, all with a renewed perspective that solidified how I want to tackle this paper. I wrote a short draft for my introduction, which more realistically outlines its aims. I also think that the structure outlined in a previous post will be modified by merging the overview concerning “what the Halaf?” with the section on common assumptions and problems. This introduction (with more meat added to it, perhaps) will precede that section:\nIn archaeology pertaining to the prehistory of southwest Asia and Anatolia, the Halaf is commonly referred to as a cultural identity, a geographical expanse, a chronological period, and a specific form of material culture. As Stuart Campbell (1999) has pointed out, the true meaning of the Halaf has been mis-conceptualized ever since the initial identification of Halaf-style pottery in 1911 (Von Oppenheimer?) at the eponymous Tell Halaf type-site. The Halaf as a cultural identity has persistently been referred to as a physical entity that occupied space and time, and physically manifested on maps as the area between concretely delineated cultural borders. Realistically however, such references seem to be based upon a foundation laid down during the early 20th century that does not adequately represent past realities (Campbell 1999). Moreover, any discussion concerning the ways in which the Halaf emerged from prior cultural contexts defined in similar ways, or of other regionally oriented trends developed under a similar framework, will only work to refine this extended construct. In order to more effectively understand past realities, it is necessary to decouple the available data from the aforementioned restrictive and top-down framework. Instead, the archaeological data should be situated within a social perspective that captures its role within the formation of community identities, and use such interpretations to derive conclusions concerning broader scale interactions or delimitations. Moreover, it is important to maintain a heterarchical perspective that allows for the nature of a social system (e.g. power relationships, clusters of shared identity, etc.) to be understood as the result of the distributed and collective agency of all members of society.\nThe aim of this paper is to characterize the Halaf from a renewed social perspective through a reassessment of regional models and an analysis of obsidian circulation networks. More specifically, a practice theoretic approach will be taken to evaluate the variability of material culture across northern Mesopotamia and the northern Levant regions during the 6th millennium B.C., with a particular focus on the ways by which obsidian was procured, worked and used. Although similar work has been conducted quite recently (cf. Campbell 2000:21-22; Campbell and Healey 2013; Healey 2007; Healey and Campbell 2014), here I hope to more explicitly relate the principles of practice theory as derived from Pauketat (2007), Pauketat and Alt (2005) and Joyce (2004), who emphasize the formation of political economies in their work –– a topic that lies at the heart of discussion surrounding the nature of the Halaf.\nI also started the next section, and I’m going at a slower yet more thoughtful pace. I’m trying to be more strategic in my writing, but sometimes it seems that I’m overthinking or over-interpreting things. I also may need to expand my reading base concerning overviews of the Halaf, since I find myself relying on a handful of sources. They are quite authoritative and are cited often, but I think this is creating a bit of an echo chamber effect."

We arrived after sunset so we couldn’t do anything exciting, but today we rented a jeep and went on the trails. I got a bunch of great photos of the mountains, although we didn’t see any animals at all. Now we’re at the Grand Canyon, where we will go on a mule ride partway down the gorge.\nI also got a lot done for my grad applications. I sent in all of my letters of intent, and I started contacting potential supervisors. In many of these small towns there is not much to do at night so it’s good to be productive. It’s amazing how much can get done when you are across the continent from home."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTubes by Andrew Blum is an interesting book (primarily geared towards non-academics) about the physicality of the internet. People tend to participate in the world wide web without considering the fact that the internet is based upon tangible infrastructure. It is indeed a series of tubes through which we communicate, socialize, trade and interact with distant parts of the world. Because of the great things that this heightened connectivity brings us, it is easy to get caught up in the relational aspects as a general user. Blum’s tour of the internet as a device of human construction really brings to light the forces that make it all possible. While his primary focus is to find the internet — to explore it as one would traverse a continent — he accomplishes much more than that. Blum also provides a great overview of the economic and social aspects that make the internet tick.\nI feel as though Tubes deals with many issues that archaeologists using network analysis face as well. Scattered archaeological evidence indicates that mechanisms for exchange existed. Presumably artefacts and ideas other than what is manifested in the archaeological record traversed the area alongside these physical objects. In one sense, networks based on the distribution of artefacts are reconstructed in order to raise the possibility that they acted as conduits for broader interaction. From another perspective, networks based on hypothetical models may emphasize the potential for connections to occur with variable weight, and archaeological material may be used as guides for setting values to the parameters set forth under the model. So two clear ways of conducting archaeological network analysis are described briefly here, but one thing is clear: the interplay between the physical manifestations of what archaeologists twist into networks and the social, economic and geographical factors that fostered connectivity is a crucial aspect to each mode of thought. In a very similar vein, Andrew Blum highlights the economic, social and geographical variables that underpin the entire system, and he synthesizes them all to characterize the structure and complexity of the system as a whole.\nBlum also recognizes that whether or not users of the internet understand the inner workings of the system that directs many aspects of their lives, it still plays a major role. The western world is much more connected through the internet than the global south, and the lack of even participation may prove to be detrimental. The distribution of connections that form the internet immensely influences entire populations, and even alters our perceptions of world around us. Moreover the network is dynamic, following economic and socio-cultural fluctuations — the ways that these forces change over time may have profound effects on the electronic linkages that form. Again, a striking similarity between the topics that Blum covers and archaeological network analysis is apparent. While prehistoric travellers and traders may not have recognized the extent of the networks that they traversed, the paths that they followed, perhaps influenced by social-cultural or economic concerns, influenced where they would end up and what kinds of information crossed their paths.\nI guess I don’t really have any specific point to make here, except to draw attention to how these issues that archaeologists face are being addressed by Blum in an interesting way. However I do think that archaeologists should consider deeper integration between network analysis and geography-oriented methodologies, since the data that we look at tends to be geographical in nature — the distribution of artefacts is often used as the basis networks constructed from archaeological material, and physical distance or elevation data are often considered important variables within interaction models. I singled out geography as an area in need of more focus, but as mentioned above I consider economic or social processes as crucial elements to account for as well. However, geographical data is relatively easy to collect, can be quantified and neatly organized into digital databases, and can be analyzed using already-developed tools, whereas social and economic considerations are often inferred from careful analysis and interpretation of manifestations in the archaeological record. In any case, it is important to develop frameworks that will enable these different-yet-complementary facets of archaeological (and related) networks to be integrated. These considerations are measured in different ways, are analyzed differently, and are discussed differently, but it is necessary to bridge these gaps carefully and explicitly in order to stitch them together effectively. I think that the development of such a framework, perhaps in the form of a set of guidelines or questions that are important to consider, should be a main priority in the coming years as interest in these fields continues to expand."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis week I read William Balée’s 2006 article The Research Program of Historical Ecology along with some other writings on more ecologically-driven approaches to anthropological notions of space, place and landscape. Balée starts off by outlining the main postulates of historical ecology, which he considers to be a set of ideas adopted by certain likeminded scholars that frame discussion along similar lines of thought. The author summarizes these tenets as follows:\n\n\nPractically all environments on Earth have been affected by humans, including in a broad sense behavioural activities of the genus Homo, although others would limit the wide-ranging effect of humans on the environment to only the entire time dating from the beginning of the Holocene, that is, the time coinciding with the beginning of agriculture;\nhuman nature is not programmed genetically or otherwise to lessen or augment species diversity and other environmental parameters;\nit follows that kinds of societies defined by various socioeconomic, political and cultural criteria impact landscapes in dissimilar ways … and\nhuman interactions with landscapes in a broad variety of historical and ecological contexts may be studied as a total (integrative) phenomenon\n\n\nHistorical ecology is framed by Balée as being empirical yet guided by social theoretic perspectives that tend to be primarily situated on the middle to low theory range. He compares the research program of primary interest with other ways of thinking about human-environment interaction, and after wading through some of the more pedantic differentiation or commonalities posed by the author, I do actually recognize some diversity. Following Dr. Roddick’s suggestion, I tried to think about the disciplinary divisions as a landscape of sorts, and I even sketched out a mind-map on a napkin.\nAlthough I won’t summarize all of that chicken scratch right now, it is clear that historical ecology takes on more of the middle and low ranges of theory, in that the effects of certain actions are thoroughly assessed, and that human social, economic and cultural organization is considered in a rather broad way that focuses on cultural processes akin to most other current anthropological perspectives adopted by archaeologists. However Balée does take for granted certain ideas that I feel should be re-evaluated. For instance, his notion that historical ecology arose out of the inadequacy of prior schools of thought to consider human-environment interaction in complex societies (p. 76) presumes that a strict division exists between societies deemed either as complex or simple, at least in the minds of certain scholars. While historical ecology does seem to bridge this dichotomy by thinking of cultural process in a broader sense, a more thorough overview of what is meant by those terms as used in this review, and as they were used by those who the author is critical of, would have been nice to include.\nAnother concern I have is how impact is considered and defined. The scale of time or of actions (e.g. the interplay between the idea of one person ploughing a field or tending to crops vs. ‘agriculture’ being defined as a socio-economic phenomenon) for a change wrought by humans to be considered long-term isn’t clearly defined, however it is implied that the triggering or disturbance of an agglomerating system by a human is of primary consideration. This confusion is understandable since individual actors and actions are often difficult to highlight in such a system that is said to represent ‘society’ and the impact of the collective (especially when looking back in time), but little acknowledgement of these challenges is given. I think that this is important when thinking about middle-range assessments because everything we observe in such a way is the result of many individual actions performed by people who possess their own agency alongside and separate from their neighbours or other members of the collective. I think that Balée dismisses the discipline of environmental history too harshly, and that its tendency to focus on evaluation of historical case studies may actually be useful for examining the potential impacts of certain kinds of actors to the development of a system.\nThis is a great overview of the disciplinary boundaries and theoretical variation that exist in a seemingly focused field of study, but in general it also reinforces an archetype of the position of anthropology among other neighbouring disciplines such as classics, environmental science and history. Classics tends to be more focused on minutia in particular societies as viewed from a socio-political perspective, (I think that classics has the potential to go way beyond the study of Classical Greece and Rome, and to develop its own middle-range perspectives, but I’ll hold off on this discussion for now). environmental science grounds the foundation of arguments in facts of nature from a scientific angle, and history allows us to think about the relationships between temporal scales, whereas anthropological archaeology deals with socio-economic and cultural dynamics on a very middle-range theoretical scale. In this article historical ecology, which is highly influenced by anthropological perspectives, is positioned as a unifying knot that can tie the other sub-disciplines mentioned together, (This brings to mind the quote by Alfred Kroeber, “Anthropology is the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities.”) but anthropology may also be perceived of as having its very own focus that should be recognized more explicitly. Social theory is a great way to tease out these idiosyncrasies and enable the work done among these disciplines to be stitched together in a more complementary fashion.\n\nComments\nAndy: Hi Zack, That’s quite a mind map! (It would be interesting to see that digitally). You can imagine how this would represent one corner of our theoretical landscape, with some like Balée and Clark Erickson (anyone note that he was thanked at the end of this article?) spending considerable time, whereas others doing landscape studies may not visit at all. Which, of course, begs the question why/why not? I wonder if you can explain this a bit: “it is clear that historical ecology takes on more of the middle and low ranges of theory, in that the effects of certain actions are thoroughly assessed, and that human social, economic and cultural organization is considered in a rather broad way that focuses on cultural processes akin to most other current anthropological perspectives adopted by archaeologists.” A little later you suggest that anthropological archaeology deals primarily at the middle-range level (as opposed to history). Perhaps others have thoughts too?\nZack: Maybe I’m using these terms wrong, but I was referring to the low/middle/high ranges of theory mentioned briefly in the last class. High theory was described as more lofty, low theory was referred to with regards to more direct interpretation of the material record, and middle was described as situated somewhere between the other two. I may have been generalizing when I stated my views on the focuses of different disciplines, but I do think that there are certain emphases on these ranges, guided by the questions that each tries to address and the evidence that tends to be considered.\nSean: My understanding is that middle-range theory had its origins in things like ethnoarchaeology and experimental archaeology, which allow us to make certain assumptions (or interpretations) of behaviours or activities in the past based on current observations. It considers things like taphonomic processes and bioturbation, and other effects of time and environment on the archaeological record, to judge how cultural deposits are disturbed over long periods of time. Call me crazy, but that sounds awfully similar to what we have been reading about historical ecology. It takes input from various fields and observations in the present (i.e. geography, biology, agriculture, fishing, forestry, you name it) and applies them to the past, ultimately curious in the cumulative effects of human interaction with the environment (a.k.a. landscape). I think that because of this, and because it examines communities on a regional scale and therefore their interactions with other communities or cultures, historical ecology is primarily a middle and high range theory. It looks at long-term processes that are applicable cross-culturally and within complex landscapes."

I made this database for my M.A. thesis, which utilizes network analysis in order to assess and re-conceptualize Neolithization and regional interaction in this setting. I recently made DObsiSS available on Github, so anyone can access the data or commit modifications. Although Github (and the git protocol at its core) is primarily a code-sharing platform, it’s seen some great applications in the realm of academic writing and scientific database management. A great introduction to git for scientists and academics is available here, and a more practical guide can be found here.\nI think that there is a lot of potential for the use of git to manage archaeological databases. It enables data sharing and re-use, encourages collaboration and communication among members of the community, makes work more transparent, and breaks down the common notion that archaeological databases exist in isolation or can ever be “complete”. Interestingly, the antithesis to these concerns seem to be the thorniest issues in archaeological data management.\n\nThe Database of Obsidian Sourcing Studies (DObsiSS): Using Git for Collaborative Management of Archaeological Data\nThe Database of Obsidian Sourcing Studies (DObsiSS) is an integrated listing of chemically characterized archaeological obsidian compiled from published journal articles, excavation reports, conference papers and other scholarly records. Obsidian is a volcanic glass that was used throughout prehistory to produce razor sharp cutting tools, and it has chemical properties that enable archaeologists to identify the source from which the raw material derives. This information is used to determine whether the inhabitants of a site participated in large-scale exchange networks, as well as the capacity of their involvement. Although a large amount of data has been generated over the years, obsidian sourcing studies tend to be done independently, with results published in journals aimed towards specialized researchers, detailed in regional-journal field reports, or kept as supplementary material in databases held by archaeometric laboratories. Aside from the issue of data accessibility, the redundancy of published results and a lack of standardization among laboratories complicate efforts to compare and analyze all of this information. The database presented here is the result of an effort to make this immense wealth of data more useful for archaeologists or for academics of other disciplines.\nDObsiSS is an open access online resource that is continuously updated to include newly published data. The database operates using git –– a collaborative data sharing protocol that allows anyone to commit proposals for modification, submit new content to be added, and track any changes in a transparent manner. It is also a great platform for discussion, where anyone may enquire about particular proposed modifications or make suggestions for larger improvements. This effort to compile all obsidian sourcing data into a central repository is a great use case for archaeological applications of git, which was designed so that content may be easily expanded, to encourage greater collaboration among researchers, and to enable fact checking and error reporting from knowledgeable members of the community. This poster presentation outlines the implementation of git as it pertains to DObsiSS, and highlights the potential benefits of its wider adoption by archaeologists."

    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to improve upon my writing abilities, it is first necessary to recognize the workflows that I tend to follow. This blog post is meant to be a reflection of my current writing processes, noting the conditions that enable me to write best, and also the factors that slow me down and cause writers block.\nI’m going to start off on a positive note. What are the conditions that enable me to write well, get on a roll, and hammer down ideas like It’s nobody’s business? First of all, I like writing in a busy environment. I like working in coffee shops, atriums, lobbies, libraries or even household kitchens or living rooms. However, I prefer to be by myself at the same time. I know this seems contradictory, but I must be isolated within a crowd in order to do my best writing, like sitting alone in a coffee shop for instance. If I am forced to write at a desk in my room, away from hustle and bustle, I tend to play some ambient instrumental music, which gets me into a rhythm. This helps the ideas flow onto a page, and allows me to skip over a troubled sentence, preserving the rhythm that the song provides for me. I can go for hours like this without leaving my desk, and if I get up to get some water or do some other mundane task, this ‘roll’ will probably be over when I get back.\nI find that when I write productively I enter a certain mindset that breaks very easily. Before I start I try to conclude my prior thoughts, perhaps by finishing up my leisurely online reading list or sending off an email that I’ve been contemplating about. But this can backfire, I can find an article that links me to a chain of other articles, or I could get side-tracked into dealing with whatever the email is about.\nI also try to make sure that everything I need is within arms reach. I close every non-relevant program on my computer, I open the most important sources on my PDF reader/browser (I find that reading PDFs in Chrome is best), and I clear my desk so only essential things are right next to me. I have a pretty broad desk that allows me to spread out, but some coffee shops have very small tables that don’t permit you to stretch out.\nAfter reflecting on my writing habits, it seems that I work in two stages. First I try to get my main ideas onto paper (or rather a word processor) in a cohesive and comprehensive way. I find that once these ideas are down, which is often the main challenge for me, supplementary work is much easier. This would consist of reorganizing and smoothing out paragraphs, transitioning ideas, linking back to the thesis, or adding examples or analogies to illustrate a point. I sometimes get side-tracked when doing this. I could get carried away with a certain side-point that I try to emphasize too much, or I could be looking for an example from previous work on the topic when I stumble across another somewhat relevant article that takes me in a different direction. I often have to remind myself that I have a paper to write, and that I have to continue on the course that I laid out. So the ‘roll’, the uninterruptible mindset that enables me to get a paper finished, could be applied to both of these stages of writing.\nIf there’s one way to characterize my writing process, It’s this: once I’m in ‘the zone’ I tend to be very productive. It’s getting there, and staying there, that is the main challenge for me.\n\nComments\nK-Bish: I completely agree with you about needing to be in the zone or “on a roll”, as well as needing background noises. I think that by being in a group of other people doing their own thing I’m forced to be more focused on things and less distracted; I’m at that coffee shop for a reason and cannot leave until it’s accomplished! But if I’m with other people at the table, their actions will distract me, or they will interrupt me in a way that dissolves that ‘roll’. Do you feel that you have to be in the zone to do any editing as well? I find sometimes that I need to edit in chunks, and that I cannot be in a busy environment when I’m editing.\nZack: The main challenge for me is getting my main thoughts on paper, and then I go through the process linking them all together. Once it’s all there, reviewing it is much easier for me. I go through each recognizable portion of my paper, then a full run-down to see if the revised version could be read naturally by my expected audience. After this I tend to take a long break (usually a day) in order to review it later with fresher eyes.\nMatthew: Zack, I know exactly what you mean when on a ‘roll’ is interrupted by a glass of water, or food, or something interesting on the internet, or, ‘stare at the wall for 30 minutes because, incidentally, the wall just might provide the information or motivation needed to finish that paragraph’. I’m just kidding, but seriously, do walls contain academic information? These are the distractions that distort the flow of information from brain to paper, and I can totally relate. I can also relate to the solitary/public writing contradiction. At times, that ambient music may be substituted by background human conversation. Coffee shops are ideal for this because, like us, some people there to write and read, too. Sometimes just being in spaces where other people are writing is enough to motivate me to work. Is this the case for you as well? Monkey see, monkey do, I guess!\nZack: I think it also has to due with the upbeat tone that occurs in these kinds of public environments. Not only are other people doing work in coffee shops, there are people moving around, being playful, and in general the room is energetic. I think that as I’m placed in this kind of environment, I adopt similar behaviours or mindsets that the people or environment exhibit. I think that the overall ambience of a situation or setting has a lot to do with how I write.\nAndy: “Sometimes just being in spaces where other people are writing is enough to motivate me to work.” Yes. And this, again, is the need to make writing a social practice, not something you chain your desk to do…to remind you, in a way, that you are writing for others as well well as yourself.\nAnnabelle: I completely relate when you say you need to isolate yourself. I too like to listen to music to do so but I unfortunately can’t listen to anything with lyrics or else I will start to sing along. I also wish I could go to a coffee shop to write (there are so many nice ones!) but I find I end up people watching as it is more interesting then what I am trying to accomplish. I completely agree that I need to clear my desk and computer screen so as to not be distracted. Do you find you work better at a particular time of day? To be in a busy setting I imagine that the afternoon would be the most productive.\nZack: I usually shuffle around for a bit in the morning, reading interspersedly while clearing some housework out of the way. I have a hard time sitting still for long periods of time so the on-and-off reading keeps me from getting bored. Also, I find that doing mundane tasks like clearing clutter or laundry give me a chance to reflect on what I just read. In the end I generally start writing at around noon.\nJonathan: Zack, that’s interesting that you like noise going to in the background while you are writing. I find that my tendencies are the opposite, and that complete silence is the only way for me to focus. In fact, your type of background noise is what tends to put me asleep as I find it distracts my mind. Also, I like having items I need to write far from arms length so I am given an excuse to take a break.\nAni: Hi Zack Thanks for an interesting post! How did you realize that you worked better in bustling environments? Having enjoyed the links you’ve shared with the class, I’m curious about the role(s) that online readings play in your writing process. You mentioned starting your work day by finishing things, like email or readings, that might weight on your mind and distract you while you work; but also how “on-and-off reading” help you stay alert and interested. I have a similar approach; I engage in intermittent reading when trying to write, as a way to lure my brain into a certain linguistic style or to help myself get the distance necessary to think more broadly about a question. In practice, though, reading often ends up being a procrastinatory tool more than anything else. How do you manage to get the positive sides of the distraction that reading provides without falling prey to the negative ones?\nZack: Hi Ani. Like you wrote in your post, I too go back and forth between reading and writing. It does help me develop tone, but it’s mainly because I’m not so great at taking notes while reading. I always end up checking the original text of the source I’m citing at some point because of my uncertainties in my notes, and then I get distracted by something I haven’t noticed, or I see a related article in google scholar, etc. I’m trying to work on my note taking to try and solve this issue."

Recently I’ve been exchanging letters with my 102 year-old great aunt who, despite her age, is not lacking any curiosity about the world around her. I’m always interested in her opinions about the future, because she has lived through so much and has remarkable experiences to base her visions on. Lately we’ve been talking a lot about space exploration and the things that humankind has accomplished, and what we have yet to achieve. I’ve been trying to find some books to send her and I found a document published in 1958 called Introduction to Outer Space. This pamphlet was published by U.S. President Eisenhower’s Science Advisory Committee that explains some of the details that are faced when launching satellites, rockets, and other kinds of vehicles and equipment into space. This pamphlet was originally addressed to the former president himself and was therefore written in a way that a layman (or even a politician) could understand.\nIt’s a very interesting read, highlighting the general attitude towards space exploration during the late 1950s, 11 years before humans stepped foot on the moon. It also includes a general timeline of research objectives and potential feats that scientists of the time believed would be accomplished soon. Among the items on this list, only one is still incomplete."

    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis week I came up with an excellent idea that I submitted to the McMaster library’s suggestion box. My suggestion is for an app that would help students search for books on their phones, find them in the stacks, discover other useful material similar to what they searched for, and make use of library resources that students may not be unaware of. There are so many deficiencies within the “process” of going to the library that can be improved upon drastically. I spent much of this week contemplating what an ideal library app would look like and imagining the ideal library system. Below are some of my ideas that can help solve many common problems by utilizing mobile technology in a constructive and innovative way. Feel free to comment with any input or ideas that I may have overlooked.\nSearching for books on the go or within the stacks is quite difficult. The current process of going to the library requires the formulation of a mission, preparation of a hit list, and then embarking on a hunt. You have a book in mind, you go search it within the catalogue on a PC, write it down on a post-it and then head to the stacks. But what if you remember another book you may need, but there is no PC nearby? The library website is not mobile-optimized, which is very inconvenient. There are computers on each floor, but remembering the call numbers can be confusing. This hypothetical app would have a clean, mobile-optimized interface for searching through the catalogue. Metadata and call numbers can be saved to a favourites list (which is already implemented in your library account) so people can find books on the go. This also eliminates the clutter of little pieces of paper with illegible notes, which is one of my biggest pet peeves.\nAdditionally, I often find myself in the stacks and I stumble upon useful material that did not appear in my search results. Scanning the shelves is a very useful way to find books you may have missed, however this is time consuming, and people of various heights or people with disabilities may not be able to see books on certain shelves. A possible solution involves the placement of QR codes on shelving units, which when scanned would display all the books on that shelf. This could take the form of lists or cover flows for an aesthetic touch. Additionally, this can be personalized by utilizing the library’s subject category system, as well as the traditional Dewey Decimal System to display books that are most relevant above others.\nQR codes can also be used to inform students about library resources. One common gripe that librarians expressed when I attended THATCamp GTA at Ryerson University in October 2011 was that students weren’t using the library as a resource, but merely as a quiet place to study. QR codes placed on posters, screens or stickers can be used to provide more in-depth information regarding library resources such as schedules for workshops, announcements of lecture series or links to tutoring services. More logistical information can also be transmitted via QR code, such as citation style guides (sent directly to dropbox perhaps), access to the suggestion box, hours of operation.\nSelf-checkout could also be much easier by using this app. The self checkout machines do not work with my student card for some mysterious reason, and I’m not the only one with this issue. Lines for checkout can be quite long, often when only one librarian is on duty. If library accounts are linked with phones people wouldn’t have to scan their cards at all. You would just have to scan the barcode on the book, demagnetize it, and walk out of the library. Simple.\nPush notifications could also be used as reminders to return their books on time. Receipts that indicate when a book is due are easy to lose, and students are only reminded to return books the day after its due when the library notifies that a charge has been made on their account. The ability to receive notifications a day or two before and renew books from the app can be extremely useful. It could facilitate the promptness of book returns and save students money. Payment of library fees is also possible using an app.\nCurrently, the use of mobile technology by universities usually takes the form of a re-skinned website or the display of already existing information on a phone’s browser. Companies that “app-ify” the websites of universities really do nothing to enhance the experience of students. The app that I’m proposing actually fills a genuine need rather than simply boasting a mobile-savvy attitude for the university. This app can act as a model, utilizing the innovative technology that exists within modern mobile phones instead of merely treating it like a miniature browser. All of the potential features mentioned above are feasible: the catalog, relevant metadata and student accounts are all there. But this shouldn’t stop libraries from developing their online facilities further. APIs can be opened up, there could be synchronous connections with interlibrary loans systems, and digital repositories could be made more accessible. The current system is far from ideal, and we must keep developing the existing infrastructure into something greater. We live in the 21st century, but our library systems are archaic. We need to move forward.\n\nComments\nA.M. Christensen: This is an excellent idea! I would add that it would be great to add, to the QR code or some other fashion, books that should be on a given shelf, but have been moved to remote storage. As you say, shelf browsing is a great way to find related materials, but that doesn’t work when things are never on the shelf. Cover flow could be very nice for this. And the ability to tag books would be nice. I frequently remember books by their size and/or color. So it would be great to be able to associate that info in my notes.\nZack: Thanks! That’s a great point that I hadn’t considered. Maybe it could even be hooked up to worldcat. I’m sure they have an API. Add Zotero functionality and it’s golden!\nI was also just thinking, there could be even more extensive use of crowdsourcing. A wiki server can be set up that associates each book with a page where people can include notes or references to other related sources. All metadata can be included, as well as lists of sources that cited the book, scraped from google scholar. Anything could potentially be included, such as the results of any citation analysis, topic modelling, or any other meta-analysis."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFor this sixth blog post for Writing the Field, I will review a very strong conference presentation. My aim is to examine the structure of the presentation and other aspects relating to form and mode of communication. I chose to watch a recording of Tom Brughmans’ presentation titled Networks of networks: a critical review of formal network methods in archaeology through citation network analysis and close reading, which he gave at Digital Humanities 2012 at the University of Hamburg in July 2012. Brughmans conducted a citation analysis centered on archaeological publications that utilized network analysis. The research that Brughmans presents is very well suited for this conference, as he utilized network analysis to examine how others in his field have used these tools, which are often encompassed under the umbrella of digital humanities.\nNotably, Brughmans does not use slide-based presentation software such as Microsoft Powerpoint or Apple Keynote, but instead uses Prezi. Prezi allows you to present your work as if it is all laid out on a canvas, and enables you to zoom and pan along as you focus in on finer details or depict a broader scheme. It is a highly visual teaching aid that allows a viewer to gain a clear conceptual picture of the content, akin to a map composed of many scales. Prezi is especially useful to present research composed of various embedded components, such as Brughmans’ work. He examined how a set of 70 initial publications cited each other, and also looked at other ‘degrees’ of citations that extend from these initial works (the interrelations between all citations of these 70 publications, and all citations of these citations in turn).\nInterestingly, I noticed that I focused less on the physicality of Brughmans, as I was so engaged with the visual aspect of the presentation. However, he still maintained a presence as a narrator, guiding the viewer through the introduction, the data and methods, the various degrees of analysis, and the conclusions. It’s reminiscent of Khan Academy videos, wherein you only see the depictions of the concepts on a multi-scalar black background, drawn as you go along with the course, but you never Salman Khan’s face. One flaw I noticed, however, is that there were many long sentences used throughout, which Brughmans read almost verbatim. Instead, I think it would be better to keep these points abbreviated, elaborating on them based on more detailed notes kept behind the podium.\nAlso interesting, is that Brughmans presented his work as a narrative, pointing out how his analyses either confirmed his expectations or surprised him. When his results were unexpected, he explained his thought processes that led him to take the next step of his analyses. Brughmans was also sure to point out the amount of work that he put in, especially regarding manual data entry. This helped illustrate some of the limitations that he faced and how it would be difficult for anyone to overcome them, considering the size of the dataset. In spite of this, It’s a good way of showing to the audience that he was directly involved in collecting, mining, analyzing, and interpreting the data, and that this research was entirely dependant on his efforts.\nOverall, I think that this presentation was very good. I look forward to seeing him present in person sometime in the near future.\n\nComments\nShawn: Did you note who was v. central? ahem ahem cough cough\nZack: Of course! It would increase my eigenvector centrality as well (if my undergrad thesis was published, that is)\nAnnabelle: Hi Zack! I have heard of prezi before. It seems to me that it really helps create flow into a presentation. I’m glad the presenter was able to develop a narrative. For the past few days I’ve tried to think about it myself and haven’t come up with much. Would you consider a similar narrative for your own presentations? Would you modify it?\nZack: So far I haven’t had much to present, so I haven’t had much use for prezi as of yet. I think it’s best for recounting your mindsets at various phases of a research project, similarly to how Allen and Joyce (2010) describe some really engaging talks that strike the audience as a form of oral history, albeit in a metaphorical sense.\nKat: Hey Zack, I’m glad someone was able to discuss a presentation that utilized Prezi. I’ve seen them utilized before and I’ve never fully appreciated the approach. You have done a great job of explaining their use, but I usually find them quite distracting. I think the concept of linking ideas is great, and your analogy of highlighting a canvas is quite good, but as a visual learner I have a harder time keeping track of how the ideas tie together. I almost felt the need to have an overarching picture to see how everything was connected at a macro scale, to understand the micro-connections they were making. Do you think that there is a way that Prezi could overcome this issue, or that it is sufficient the way it is currently?\nZack: Well, I wouldn’t put all the blame on the tools. I find that people tend to use novel tools just for the sake of using them. I think prezi is versatile enough that it can be moulded in many ways, and used for a variety of purposes, but there are ‘rules’, just as there are standard aspects of utilizing powerpoint. Practically every university has a webpage describing how to ‘properly’ design a powerpoint presentation. I’m sure if one would look closely enough, some common features of great prezi presentations would come to light, and standards would become apparent. In short, both powerpoint and prezi have their limitations. They enable people to convey an idea in different ways, but a certain mode of communication may not be suitable for what the presenter has in mind.\nShawn: It’s all about metaphors. If your material is suited to a metaphor of movement, of zooming, then Prezi is a natural fit (if well designed). I could imagine doing a presentation about an archaeological site that first zoomed through from Google Earth, to pre-excavation pics, to post-excavation pics, to individual contexts, to records, etc. Instead of presenting it, one would leave it up on a website to encourage non-linear exploration of the site. …but of course, movement for movement’s sake just induces vertigo…"

    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the book chapter I read this week - Yi-Fu Tuan’s Space, Time, Place: A Humanistic Frame — the author outlines how space, time and place are commonly conceptualized from a humanistic (= anthropological?) perspective. He examines the nature of these these elements (for lack of a better term) at four scales (I’m unsure if “scale” is used in the same way we refer to it). This chapter is divided into sub-sections encompassing discussion pertaining to each of these scales, which are labeled as follows:\n\ntime in mythic space;\nGreek-Hebrew models of space, time and place;\ntime and experiential space; and\ntime and place.\n\nTime in mythic space: Tuan observes that mythic space occurs in three ways: cosmogonic, astronomic, and human. The first kind refers to origin myths, the second to observations of natural phenomena, and the third to human experiences. While the author notes that cosmogonic and human space tend to be expressed in terms of linear development (a progression from beginning to end), astronomic space is more rhythmic or cyclical in nature. Tuan then outlines various conceptualizations of mythic space through ethnographic examples in order to illustrate how these conceptions are actually put into practice.\nSpace, time, place: Greek-Hebrew models: Tuan then goes over two case studies wherein he outlines supposed conceptualizations of space pertaining to Greek and Hebrew societies. However I found this section extremely problematic in a couple ways. First, the author did not draw upon enough primary sources derived from classical texts and archaeological evidence in order to derive his arguments in a convincing way (at least to me, a former classics student). Am I to assume that Tuan’s reference to Pericles’ speeches, without pointing to specific notions that this Athenian politician may have presented, are representative of Athenian — let alone pan-Hellenic — attitudes? Tuan also generalizes the group of people he refers to as Hebrews, who probably had very distinctive conceptualizations of space, time and place at different points in time (pre- and post-diaspora, for instance). However as I read this while sitting with family who came together from many places to celebrate the Jewish new year, I do recognize some truth in Tuan’s representation of Jewish (or Hebrew) tendencies to “build in time” and “temporalize” the structures they build (p. 10). But this should not be compartmentalized as a Jewish phenomenon, and may also potentially be observed in other groups exhibiting similar histories and community structures.\nI also believe that Tuan used this section to construct a notion of “western” conceptions of space, time and place. I only bring this up because we discussed this in earlier blog comments and in class, and I don’t want to open that can of worms again, but the idea that early Medieval models of the universe were derived as a synthesis of Greek and Hebrew conceptualizations seems overly simplistic to me. Although additional arguments against this notion can likely be made, it is easiest to point out the considerable temporal gaps between Classical Greece (5th century BCE), 1st century AD Judaism/Christianity, and the Early Middle Ages (c. 400 - 1000 AD).\nTime and experiential space: This section describes how space is used to convey notions of time, and vice versa. Tuan prompts discussion by referencing many common colloquial phrases, and the implied meanings behind them, that refer to time in spatial terms. However I find that some of Tuan’s interpretations crossover with ideas he presents in his first section dealing with mythic representations of space. Now perhaps I’m confusing apples and oranges here, but I felt that the author’s example of his drive to and from work at dawn and dusk complicates the notion he presents earlier that human space is conceptualized in linear terms. A purely linear perspective of time supports an intentional aspect to agency, with each person reading their own path — however the social structure in which we live brings habit into our lives, such as the cycle of driving to and from work at specific points in the day. Although Tuan only wrote this book chapter around a year after Giddens’ canonical work was published, I do think that perspectives of time play into ideas of agency and structure and should be explored more thoroughly in this light. I also think that this must tie in to the different wavelengths of history presented by Braudel and other members of the Annales School, but to be honest I am not entirely sure how they explicitly relate. Perhaps this will be discussed in more detail next class, and the relationship between structuration theory and the annales school will be made more clear.\nMoreover, in this section Tuan explains how contemplation influences our perceptions of distance and extent of time. After reading his quote, “Objects, space and time also become visible — no longer the mere coordinates for habitual behaviours — when they are contemplated” (p. 12-13), I am unsure about whether this refers to empirical measurement or critical thought. From the tone of the article the latter is implied, however for some reason this brings to mind Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (which dictates that an object or entity whose properties are measured is altered through the act of physical observation, and is thus not in its natural or pristine state that it takes when unobserved), which is more concerned with the observation of physical things. Are the conceptual and physical dictated by the same laws or guidelines? Perhaps this question would be better addressed to humanists or philosophers.\nTime and place: I find that this section was more cryptic than the rest. There were some short phrases that seemed out out place or without context, assuming that the reader would be able to come up with the implied meaning. I do think that Tuan’s idea of place as a static state is problematic. If I remember a family trip to Maine one summer, and recall the places where I was (the town where I was staying, the house we rented, the beach, the car ride there and back, etc), I will not remember them in static ways. Instead I will remember the experiences I had with my family, which were dynamic and occurred over the course of a few weeks. The multiplicity of times and places, which transcend scales, are far from being “one relation between time and space” (Tuan’s definition of place, p. 14). Although I could not really understand the main point Tuan was trying to make in this section, I do disagree with this fundamental notion that he brings up.\nOverall synthesis: This was an interesting and fun read, however I think that it was too brief for the broad scope of ideas covered. Although I have not yet read his other work, Yi-Fu Tuan, who is credited by many as the founder of human geography, has written extensively on the relationship between space, time and place, so perhaps the criticism I made is not warranted in the larger scope of his work. However I think that this particular book chapter would have been more informative if these sections were broken up into their own dedicated works, with more elaborate discussion dedicated to the ideas presented by others whom Tuan references.\n\nComments\nAlex: I felt the same way as you Zack when I was reading this chapter. I was underwhelmed by what I thought was a lack of sources or groundwork in Tuan’s essay. Specifically, in the section “Time and Experiential Space” I was intrigued by how Tuan considered the effect contemplation has on our experience of distance and time. This is a point I hope to bring up in class with regards to Heidegger, as I think his argument is much stronger whereas Tuan seemed to lack the “philosophical rigour” I have come to expect in such discussions. The essay did feel almost like an introduction to a book, which makes me wonder like you whether our criticisms would be answered further in the project.\nMary: Zack I liked your critique of Tuan’s generalization of his Greek and Hebrew societies. I felt that his examples were over simplified versions of reality but they did fit neatly into his narrative and nicely illustrated the difficult concepts he was explaining.\nMaybe Alex is right and this chapter didn’t insight the ‘philosophical rigor’ that is usually associated with these kinds of discussions but I felt that it was written to allow an entry point for people to start understanding time and space in a new way. People, like me, who feel they are playing catch-up with experience in such theoretical and philosophical conversations, will greatly appreciate Tuan’s approach.\nSean: Zack, in response to your “humanistic = anthropological” question mark at the beginning. I think that at this point (in 1978) usage of the term “humanistic” in the field of geography was largely equated with an approach that considers “human agency” as central to their study; or in other words, they considered the value and/or visibility of the “decisions and dispositions” of humans in the archaeological record. I could be wrong, but when Tuan says “humanism” I think he just means that he is thinking in terms of how humans conceptualize and interact with the “space, time and place” that surrounds them, which I think is pretty respectable considering it was written almost four decades ago.\nIn terms of the article, I actually quite enjoyed it. Overall, I would have to agree with Mary here. It might not have been couched in the philosophical traditions that would now be required of such an investigation of these principles, but it does allow for an effective method of understanding and appreciating these issues.\nYou are certainly right to question the author’s temporal variability in his choice of case studies, but I don’t think the discrepancies are problematic in this situation. If he was using these as comparative examples in any attempt to prove their relation to each other, it probably would have been a bad move. But I think he used them as examples to illuminate how many ways human perspectives have manifested themselves in the minds and societies that have existed over time.\nAt the end, Tuan accuses the field of human geography of largely ignoring “time as a dimension of human experience” (16). Ultimately, he is proposing that the field of geography begin really considering these experiences of humanity in order to infuse a sense of reality into the geographer’s world. In this way, it is not meant as a philosophical or even anthropological piece (in terms of who the primary audience was expected to be), so we might be able to forgive him for not being so thorough in his philosophical underpinnings.\nAnd finally, as Alex mentioned, this article is situated at the very beginning of a good sized book entitled “Making Sense of Time”, so perhaps this chapter was not intended to entirely justify the humanistic approach, but merely to approach these topics and set the stage for further discussion later on. I, for one, don’t really feel like reading the rest of the book just to find out though…\nZack: Okay, it seems that I’ve been a bit too not-picky here, and after re-reading it I do see this as a useful introductory piece that gets us into the idea of what phenemenology can be about. It seems like an odd fit in relation to other readings in the syllabus, but figuring out the intended audience really clarified its value to me.\nAndy: Hey Zack, thanks for the overview — we will definitely dig into this some more tomorrow. I wonder if you or anybody else can you perhaps see what Tuan is bringing to the table that the other phenomenology we read this week aren’t? BTW, Sean is basically right on this — although more specifically the use of “humanist” is referring specifically to how geographers studied space previously, which was empirically-rich but fairly abstract and certainly not focused on the “experienced”."

I went with my parents because they’re pretty good at this sort of thing. The first thing we did was go to the campus, which is amazing. It’s so green and lush, and the buildings all have interesting designs. I love how the campus is all hilly, and there are so many large trees that must have been growing there for ages. It was a bit quiet since it’s summer and it was on a Saturday but I got a good impression of the place where I’ll be spending the next few years.\nAs for the house hunting, I trekked all around the Westdale area trying to find a good fit. I finally settled on an attic room in one house that is less than a minute away from campus. The location is amazing, the house is being fully renovated and the landlord is very reliable. I really like the general area as well. There is one fantastic coffee shop in particular where I spent some time. Overall I’m really excited about this shift and I think that this is a good environment for me."

    "text": "Note\n    \n  \n  \n    This is an old post and is probably extremely cringe. Please understand that I have moved on from these ideas. Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nI found this article written by Andrew Bevan of University College London really interesting and most relevant to my own interests. It is much more methodological in nature, and deals with issues that I hope to tackle throughout my doctoral studies. While I did take notes on some of the more minute methodological details, I’ll try to limit my comments here to broader issues that are more relevant to the course content.\nThis paper seems very processual in nature, however I don’t mean that in a negative way as is sometimes implied in some of our discussions. Bevan does invoke concepts from general/complex systems theory to document the settlement patterns on Kythera, however he does refrain from explicitly making certain conclusions in statistically-oriented language. For instance, in the section dealing with the development of intra-island hierarchies and site distributions, Bevan evaluated the potential relationships betweens the sizes of sites, the distances between them, and the concentrations of scatters, and his plots were interpreted in order to detect a potential hierarchy. He also noted the dynamic social, economic and political processes that would have led to such systems. Although Bevan never said so explicitly, his results are reminiscent of models depicting preferential attachment, which are observed in numerous natural and social settings, and which result in power law (also referred to as scale-free) statistical distributions. While this is not the setting to go into this specific phenomena and its implications, I bring this up since such models are often criticized by social scientists because they tend to dehumanize the phenomena that underlie the material (transformed into data) being analyzed. Bevan sidestepped this issue by writing in archaeological terms, however the implication that humans simply react and impose reactions may still be troubling to some.\nSimilarly, in other sections, Bevan relies on models that restrict areas of human habitation to settings that support the “lowest common denominator” of comfort and survival. Although it was never made explicit, Bevan seems to follow a form of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which prioritizes physiological requirements and safety concerns over social considerations as primary movers of human activity.\nWhile I doubt Bevan would adopt Maslow’s exact scheme, I’m of the opinion that humans are social in nature in accordance with the social brain theory (Dunbar 1998) and would give more credence to human interactions alongside largely independent needs. In light of the issues discussed in this course, these concerns relate to the role of individuals in society, and questions the degree to which we frame agency as imposed by social pressures, environmental variables, or personal motivations.\nIn any case, it is difficult to argue with the results that Bevan obtained. His evaluations do result in nice correlations that are discussed in light of anthropological and archaeological concerns, and he breaks down the assumptions that he makes in a responsible way. One could nit-pick on certain aspects of his methodology and data collections procedures, but with the exception of certain larger issues (using Kastri as an arbitrary reference point, for instance) this article seems well done in light of broader theoretical concerns. As mentioned earlier, Bevan avoids much criticism by not going too far with statistical analysis, but the underlying issues of humanistic considerations are still there and will be debated. My own stance is that we are animals and may be evaluated as such, but this does not have to be a restricting factor. For instance, as I mentioned in a previous comment regarding simulation of human activities and interactions, it may be considered more beneficial to use such methods to uncover the roles of certain processes through playing around with and tweaking various parameters (by making a game), rather than evaluating the final results or searching for the formula (playing or experiencing the game). All in all, I do see the usefulness of systems-based and computationally-modeled approaches, however they must be considered within anthropological and archaeological frameworks.\n\nCommens\nAlex: I really enjoyed this post Zack and it definitely helped me to better understand Bevan’s article. I had difficulties with this week’s readings, no doubt because of my lack of experience with GIS or any computational models to study archaeological sites. But I can’t deny that the conclusions reached in each of the articles, and specifically Bevan’s, were both sound and convincing.\nNevertheless, like you mentioned, I was wary of Bevan’s method because I felt that his reduction of the traces of fundamentally human experience into data had a tendency to “dehumanize the phenomena.” It struck me that due to Bevan’s use of GIS, he was only able to speculate (with strong, circumstantial evidence of course) certain anthropological conclusions concerning cultural activity on Kythera.\nI don’t think this necessarily weakens Bevan’s argument though, as his focus was not on uncovering lived social experience but determining “the way the landscape was structured.” In this way, I would be intrigued to see how the use of GIS or other computational models could support or engage with more post-processual theories we’ve looked at (it seems to me Kosiba and Bauer (2013) may have done this more effectively).\nSean: To use Kosiba and Bauer’s terms, I think Bevan employs more of an interpretative application of GIS, rather than an econometric stance of human adaptation to climatic and geographic conditions. In my opinion, he does a good job of introducing the human voice (or at least some of the “decisions and dispositions” responsible for shaping a constructed landscape) into an otherwise robotic practice of computer modelling that sometimes makes rash assumptions about human nature. I especially enjoyed his section 3.1 on point pattern analysis, where he uses a randomized set of points in an attempt to flush out some of the human agency in site selection. The random points are plotted against actual site locations to identify patterns in distances between sites. As it turns out, there were significantly more actual sites located between 300 and 400 m apart than for the random points, which were averaged from 1000 simulation sets. The authors determined that this represented a deliberate spacing of contemporary sites, attributed to some combination of human motivating factors that for now can only be hypothesized.\nWhile Bevan made a respectable, and largely successful, “interpretative leap from surface remains to actual settlement systems and their implications in testable, quantifiable ways” (2002:254), I think he still fell short in fully appreciating human interactions with their environment. In following Kosiba and Bauer’s conclusions about the interpretative system in GIS, the people in Bevan’s account “are lost within accounts that describe landscapes only in abstract, reductive terms of sites and regions” (2012:66). It seems that in the end, Bevan’s results concentrated primarily on numbers (i.e. population estimates) and frequency/distribution of rural sites. Perhaps he was not able to speculate more on the human decisions and activities involved because of the relative historic under appreciation or rural sites in the archaeological record. Perhaps this GIS approach was a crucial first step towards a more inclusive interpretation that consists of the political landscape, made up of all the “social categories and spatial boundaries that influence and guide how people perceive their surroundings” (Kosiba and Bauer 2013: 67).\nIn the end, Alex I think you’re correct in thinking that Bevan’s argument is not weakened by his ultimate reliance on speculative conclusions about the cultural forces responsible for the observed patterns. Like you said, his focus was to determine how the landscape was structured, not to uncover the social and political institutional foundations for the organization of Neopalatial rural Kytheran landscapes. I do think that is the next step in expanding this field of research, however, and am also interested to find out how others might engage with the current theoretical playing field.\nZack: Sean, I definitely agree with your notion that this study is one step in a larger and more inclusive interpretation of the social and political landscape, and realistically a totally holistic approach would not be possible without drawing from various perspectives. And I also appreciate Alex pointing out Bevan’s stated purpose, which I had not seriously considered in my post. This article seems like it would fit well within an edited volume containing different views on the landscape of Kythera.\nI’m left wondering whether it is necessary to adopt more phenomenological issues in GIS studies, or whether it is acceptable to take on a more systematic perspective on its own. In general I don’t see much overlap between these perspectives in the archaeology of island interactions, perhaps because the boundaries and limitations imposed by such geographies make it tempting to conduct similar systematic investigations (see Knappett, Evans, and Rivers (2008) and Broodbank (2000) for examples of this). I think that viewshed analysis and other mappings relating to human senses is a potential way of more effectively linking the phenomenological and systematic perspectives, however as noted in the comments on Daiana’s blog, such an opportunity was not fully taken advantage of by (willians2006?)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBroodbank, C. 2000.

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe second blog post for Writing the Field is meant to outline a piece of writing that I hope to complete this semester. I decided that I will work on an introduction to my MA thesis, explaining my research goals and defining the paramaters of my inquiries. Admittedly, I have had a hard time defining my research question, and I really need to solidify my research objectives.\nMy MA research will utilize social network analysis to gain a better understanding of regional interactions from the Epi-Palaeolithic to the Chalcolithic in SW Asia and Mesopotamia. Using obsidian sourcing data I will construct a network of interaction in order to document the growing complexity of regional exchange that was occurring during this broad period. During the Pre-Pottery Neolithic obsidian begins to be traded more widely, and objects are often found very distant from their volcanic sources. It is my intention to document and explain the growing complexity of interaction in this region, similarly to how Golitko et al. (2012) examined the obsidian exchange from the Mayan Classic to Postclassic periods. Certain ‘groupings’ of sites that consumed obsidian in a similar manner (either by source, typology, use or context of deposition) will become more evident through SNA methods, and I hope to compare these groupings to the occurrence of other archaeological materials (pottery styles, architectural motifs, burial customs, etc).\nAt the moment my thoughts are scattered, and I need to pick up the pieces and arrange them nicely. My research question is not very well-thought out, and I’m having a hard time coming up with an brief ‘elevator pitch’ that accurately describes what I am working on. By collecting my thoughts and writing them out I will be able to solidify my ideas and come up with a concrete research objective. Essentially I will describe how obsidian was used throughout prehistory in SW Asia and Mesopotamia, and how archaeologists have made use of the obsidian data. These are the benefits of introducing my thesis in this way: By outlining how obsidian was procured, manufactured and consumed, I provide a glimpse of the assumptions I’m making. It goes over the history of the examination of obsidian, describing past interpretations by archaeologists. Of course, emphasis will be placed on studies of regional interaction. This also gives me an opportunity to reflect on ideas developed by archaeologists who do not specialize in this region.\n\n\n\nIt sets my research within broader archaeological debates.\n\n\n\nIt allows me to segway into the benefits of using SNA methods. Most importantly, it allows me to set up the necessary ‘foundations’ that need to be explained before I get to my research objective. I find it difficult to just talk about what I am researching without situating my work within broader discussions. I find that all of the above is necessary to evoke before introducing my work. This introductory chapter will probably exceed the 20-25 pages expected for this class. However, I do find it necessary to complete this chapter before the summer, when I will be compiling a database of obsidian artefacts. Having a proper understanding of your objectives is necessary in order to collect relevant data.\nI will divide this piece of writing into components, and assign due dates for each one. The final piece is due April 12. The component outlining the production and consumption of obsidian will be due February 24. The part examining past archaeological interpretations of obsidian will be due March 15. A finished draft will be due March 20 and a second draft will be due March 27, as is stated in the course syllabus.\nI’ll also post the outlines for each component, listing all the aspects I will cover. Maybe I’ll make a google doc, and I’ll write in a different colour every time I add contrent or change things around. This will make me think critically about how I write since it is being shown to a wider audience, and it will allow me to see my train of thought once this is all finished. Also, if any of my peers in this class have any suggestions they can comment on the google doc. But perhaps this is taking things too far, I don’t want to write in fear of constant criticism. On the other hand, this kind of pressure can act as a great motivator. I like the idea of writing in non-isolation, and I was even thinking about regularly writing in this wordpress text editor  because I somehow feel more comfortable blogging. I think that it has to do with the public exposure and the relative informality that I associate with blogging. I feel that it would be beneficial to apply the way I blog to my academic writing, so maybe this is the way to go? Dr. Roddick talks about how we need to make writing more social, but does this also imply complete transparency? Perhaps I’ll try this out, and if it doesn’t work I’ll call it quits and go back to ‘normal’ writing.\nEDIT: After thinking about it, I’m considering doing a literature review instead, looking towards other relevant studies. This accomplishes the same goal, and the only thing I’ll be removing really is the first portion regarding the production and consumption of obsidian.\nEDIT 2: After some more contemplation I’ve settled on a topic. Essentially I’ll be answering these questions: How have archaeologists looked at obsidian circulation, and how can SNA be used to engage in these discussions?\nEDIT 3: I realize that I never provided a concrete outline for this, so I included one below:\n\nComments\nMatthew: Hi Zack, Seems to me that you have in the very least a rudimentary understanding about how you’re going to begin your thesis. It’s still very early, but it’s great that you’re taking the time to work out the details of your research question now, instead of waiting until next October (I’m definitely guilty of that). You alluded, briefly, to obsidian sourcing. Are you going to be analyzing trace element concentrations in the XRF lab? How well documented are the geological sources of obsidian that have been analyzed to date? Trace element concentrations in obsidian, particularly in the Mediterranean region likely vary depending on geochemistry of the lithosphere vis a vis the chemistry of the volcanic plume. Is this relatively uniform for the Mediterranean basin, or does regional geochemistry vary significantly enough to produce distinct geographic boundaries of obsidian sources?\nZack: Hi Matt, I’m going to be working with already published obsidian sourcing data, although there is a possibility that I’ll be able to do some characterization myself. For the vast majority of the data, a very large portion of which is published in a massive compendium, I’ll have to trust the published results, unless there is reason not to. In any case I’ll take into account the concerns you raised.\nK-Bish: Hello Zack, I think that you’ve done a good job of going through and narrowing your focus. This really helps to outline your discussion and start researching from here. Have you considered really explaining and introducing aspects of Social Network Analysis (SNA)? I remember it briefly being discussed in a past bioarchaeology course but this may be something necessary to fully explain or to examine the theory behind if you intend on working with it. This could be a point or section included in your 4th section, as well as a basic introduction within the beginning part of your introduction. This will provide you a chance to overview the theorists and literature that relates to SNA. Something to consider!\nZack: Noted! Thanks for pointing this out.\nAndy: Hi Zack, I’m not sure what you have settled on after your rethinking, but if I can make a suggestion: don’t plan on writing your introduction to your thesis. This is usually the last chapter you should be writing (yes, after your conclusion!). The reason is that you don’t know, exactly, what you are introducing until you have done a bunch of work. Also, an intro to a thesis is generally pretty short, so a paper longer than 25 pages is probably no longer an introduction. At this stage, I think this class project would be best served by (a) defining your research question and (b) a literature review. There is no reason that these can’t be together for the purpose of this class. In fact by tacking back and forth between a lit. review you will likely be able to tighten up the issues of interest (in light of the published sources you can draw upon). This is a similar suggestion I have for Lia over at her blog, and I think you guys will be going through a pretty similar process. Ok?\nZack: Hi Andy, thanks for your suggestions. I know I’ve been back and forth a bit and I decided that I am indeed going to do a lit review. Like you said, it’s a great way to identify key areas to focus on. I spoke with other people about this around the department and they made similar suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGolitko, Mark, James Meierhoff, Gary M.

But now I realize that I can just skip recording these details and interpret these data right on the spreadsheet. Adding this step later on would slow me down and I may not be able to run an analysis before the end of the semester, as planned. Additionally, these properties are not recorded to the same extent in every excavation report.\nDeciding what data suits your goals is tough. I have to keep in mind what my aims are, and be consistent throughout the project."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nToday I was linked an article that really caught my attention since it’s about something that I think about all the time but was never able to put into words. This is my attempt to do just that. The article is about the various computer interfaces that are displayed in movies and on television throughout the past 50 years. The main observation made by the author is that the focus shifts from hardware to software, which represents the comfort level of the contemporary audience with computers and modern technology. The rows of unmarked buttons, nonsensical interfaces and digital noise characteristic of computers depicted in Star Trek: TOS or Alien acted to confirmed people’s feelings of computers in the 60s and 70s. In contrast, the glossy touch screens of the computer systems on the Enterprise D of Star Trek TNG and the fluidity of computer interaction in Minority Report may be the result of the growing comfort levels that were developed as computers became bigger parts of people’s lives.\nLately I’ve been thinking about what we use technology for. While flying on an airplane last week I opened my computer to read some articles I saved using Pocket, and once I finished my list of “to reads” I was wondering what else I could do to kill time for the rest of my 4 hour flight. I briefly conjured up a short list of some things that I could do using my computer (that I genuinely enjoy doing) without being connected to the internet. All of these things required me to be online prior at some point or another in order to gather the content that would be consumed or manipulated. It seems that most things worth doing on a computer require an internet connection. Almost every app I have installed is based on some kind of internet-based functionality, and almost all of the documents, videos, pictures, music, etc contained on my drive have been downloaded through an online connection at some point or another. Last week when my mom wanted to view her vacation photos to her ipad while in a hotel room with no wifi, I was surprised when I realized that she would have to transfer them through a hard connection to my dad’s laptop where the SD card would be directly input. It seems that everything goes through the tubes at some point or another.\nNow, I don’t want this to seem like an attack on the internet. I practically live online. But I feel it’s necessary to point out that we have computers that are capable of doing so much, yet it seems like we are ultimately limiting ourselves due to our need to be continuously online. It’s odd that the iphone that sits in my pocket contains over 130,000 times as much RAM as was used to send people to the moon, but I can’t get much functionality out of it without connecting to the internet first.\nAgain, I’m not hating on the internet, but I do feel that we need to reconsider the nature of modern technology today. I was discussing a  similar topic with my aunt the other day and I felt that I had to justify the benefits of the internet to her, which is drowned out in a sea of consumable content that gives the web its notoriety. She believes that “internet culture” is degrading “genuine” human interactions and that social skills are being underdeveloped. But the way I see it, this is not the case. We live in the real world (or meatspace as I prefer to call it) and the internet is simply a medium in which we interact. There are many limitations that are characteristic of this system, and because of the depth to which the internet has penetrated our lives we have grown to live with them. If you take a good hard look at the consumer electronics market, you’ll note that certain elements of design shape the ways we interact online. For instance, the constant use of keyboards results in a text-based internet which resulted in the popularity of discussion boards. Because every laptop has a keyboard as the main focal point, users are influenced to use it as the primary input device. The use of tablets is allowing for much greater flexibility in this regard, however the use of skeumorphic design that imitates laptop-based attributes acts as a barrier to a functionalist use of technology.\nSimilar to the producers of sci-fi and speculative fiction of the pre-internet age, I envision a future that utilizes technology in a constructive way, emphasizing the role of human input and decision making, while being flexible enough to get the job done. Essentially, I think that computers should return to their roots, adopting a functionalist design strategy that enables people to get things done. I tend think of modern technology as a tool, an extension of my own body that I use to ease my way of life, facilitate my own needs, and fulfill my wants. This reflects the attitudes of pre-internet computer users, who envisioned future starship officers and voyagers of outer space as utilizers of advanced technology, enabling them to maneuver their ships or solve complicated problems with relative ease."

Classics is normally associated with the study of Greek and Roman culture and civic society during their respective classical periods, and the particular focus on these areas of interest is deeply rooted in western European socio-political ideals and scholarship that emerged from the Renaissance to the late 19th century. While critics of the discipline point towards the extensive research that has been done on these particular geographical and temporal settings as detriments, I believe that classics is really about the study of specific kinds of societies from a particular angle that emphasizes attention towards the nature of civic society, relationships between foreign and domestic affairs, and the impact of myth and public memory on contemporary society. While many classicists today may not realize it, this definition certainly does not limit classical research to ancient Greece and Rome. These issues were faced by many societies throughout history, and persist today. These are themes that are even commonly dealt with in fiction!\nAs my first classics professor taught me, the discipline in called classics because it is the study of a society that is considered to be in a class of its own. Under this definition, classics may be broadened to include the study of notable societies for which detailed material and textual evidence is available, examined through a critical socio-political perspective.\n[This post was never completed.]"

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the major criticisms made by my thesis committee was on my suggestion that peer-polity interaction be more readily adopted as a framework to base future network analysis studies upon. Although now I am beginning to realize my error, I think that this stems from my misunderstanding of what peer-polity interaction really was meant to address — the scaling up of polities into “fully fledged” city states (although I must read more to verify this and gain a more complete understanding — Renfrew, Ma, Schortman, Snodgrass, etc). The value that I saw (and still see) with peer-polity interaction is regarding the focus on relationships among unranked entities on the same plane, which have the potential to be ranked given the unevenness of relationships among them. This notion is probably better evoked by heterarchy, as defined by Crumley (and by Schortman who raises similar points more explicitly regarding PPI as well). But is peer-polity interaction an instance of heterarchical thought? It does emphasize the tenets of heterarchy, but perhaps with a certain more focused aim in mind. However I must find out what this aim truly is through more focused reading of the aforementioned sources, among others. Schortman seems to be key for understanding the relationship between heterarchy and PPI.\nSo I think that I can adequately re-focus chapter 2 (or was it 3?), which currently attempts to highlight comparative approaches and ppi specifically, to discussion more focused on heterarchy more broadly. Specifically, its potential use for the analysis of distributed systems is quite pertinent."

Still, it may contain some nuggets that point to some continuity in my thinking over the years, which is why I decided to post it here.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week I wrote about the potential of stepping back from the internet, moving back towards a more functionalist computing environment. That’s not to say that we should inhibit linkages between computers. I’ve been reading about the Pirate Box, as well as it’s fork Library Box, and I think that these devices represent a big step towards better support of scaled back network systems. These devices, developed using open source technology, generate networks that allow connected members to share files and interact, without connecting to the internet at large. Of course, any home or office network has these capabilities, the focus on the functionality of a single main feature breeds novel ideas regarding its implementation.\nDrawing on Library Box’s potential on university campuses, I can imagine a network of single purpose devices being utilized in order to aid research efforts. Perhaps in a library setting raspberry pi computers can be set up along with inexpensive sets of periphery devices (monitor, mouse, keyboard), and the only software installed being reading software and a very simple text-editor. These devices would solely be used to retrieve files from a Library Box, read them, and take notes. That’s it. Single purpose device such as these would reduce distractions and enable students to focus on their work.\nSuch a network is doable, and moreover it is incredibly cheap to implement. The cost of a raspberry pi device is 25$ or 35$, depending on which model is used. Mice are also quite cheap, and monitors may be allocated through donations or partnerships with hardware manufacturers. Depending on the size of the network, multiple Library Boxes may be required, but such a project may be scaled over a long period of time, spreading the costs over a few years. Additionally, it would be encouraged to utilize free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) in the spirit of the Pirate Box’s origins."
